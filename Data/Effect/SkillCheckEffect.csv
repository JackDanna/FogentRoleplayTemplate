Read Thoughts,"During the spell's effect, you gain the ability to perceive the thoughts of specific creatures. When you cast the spell you can concentrate your mental focus on any visible creature within the spell's range. If the chosen creature possesses an -2 INT or lacks the ability to communicate through language, the spell has no effect. Initially, you access the surface thoughts of the creature, revealing its predominant concerns at that moment. You have the option to shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or delve deeper into the same creature's mind. When probing deeper, the targeted creature must succeed on a Will check versus the CL of the spell. Failure allows you to glean insights into its reasoning, emotional state, and significant preoccupations (such as worries, affections, or aversions). If successful, the spell terminates. Regardless of the outcome, the targeted creature becomes aware of your mental probing. Unless you shift your focus to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to initiate an Intelligence contest against your own; success terminates the spell. This spell proves particularly effective in interrogations, as questions directed at the target creature naturally influence its thought patterns. Additionally, you can employ this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures that are not visible to you. When casting the spell or as your action during its duration, you can scan for thoughts within the spells range. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead obstruct the ability.
