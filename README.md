# Welcome to Fogent Roleplay

![Alt text](./FogentRoleplayLogo-Circle.png)

Fogent Roleplay is an open source TTRPG (Table Top Roleplay Game) intended to remove the unneeded complexity common in many TTRPGs while not sacrificing emergent/tactical gameplay. It acts as the foundation and narrative engine for your game. If you love the simplicity, flexibility, and narrative focus of Cogent Roleplay, but love tactical battle map combat, magic items, campaign progression, and sweet loot, then you are in the right place.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then D&D:

- **Narrative Focused:** Most TTRPGs feel very different in and out of combat, with non-combat roleplay having great narrative flow where your character can attempt almost anything, but once combat is entered it feels more like a video game where characters can only perform the exact actions as described in the rules. Fogent Roleplay elegantly handles combat within the narrative flow while still having balanced/tactical combat. Combat in Fogent Roleplay feels more like an awesome fight scene in a movie, rather than video game characters just trying to get each other to 0 HP.
- **Offloading Complexity to the Narrative:** The rules are purposefully built to offload as much complexity to the narrative as possible. Instead of every rule complexity/edge case turing into a legal battle between the players and Narrator, it just becomes a discussion about what would narratively make sense. Therefore, what is best for your character mechanically, what logically makes sense in the context of the setting, and what is most narratively satisfying are the same thing in Fogent Roleplay!
- **Making the Narrator's Job Easy:** Fogent Roleplay is neither designed to nor intends to have a rule for every minute situation. Instead, we want to give the Narrator a multi-tool of powerful, flexible, and intuitive rules. We want a Narrator's pre-game prep to primarily consist of creating insane plot twists, designing cool combat encounters, crafting awesome magic items, figuring out how a player character's backstory ties into the story, ect... rather than spending hours understanding needlessly complex rules.
- **Simple, Elegant, and Intuitive Rules:** While other TTRPGs require multiple books worth of rules to play, by contrast, Fogent Roleplay has ~40 pages of core rules, much of which consist of examples. This makes Fogent Roleplay extremely easy for new Players/Narrators to pick up. It is very common to spend 10 - 15 min explaining the rules from a macro level before diving into the game/story, as playing is the best way to learn.
- **Setting Agnostic:** Fogent Roleplay and it's rules aren't tied any setting. It is designed from the ground up to easily run games in existing settings or in brand-new ones you create. This way, your group can learn one system to play in various settings such as medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, galactic warfare, survival horror, etc... This makes Fogent Roleplay great for world builders and authors looking to collaboratively create/reveal their setting.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then Cogent Roleplay:

* **Innovation:** Whether it be rebalanced Core Skills, reworked Vocations, rebalanced weapons, an Advantage/Disadvantage system, rebalanced destiny point rules, automated character sheet support, etc... Fogent Roleplay has taken the best ideas of Cogent Roleplay to their logical conclusions while embracing innovation.
* **Tactical Battle Map Combat:** Fogent Roleplay has rules to be run on a battle map. This allows for awesome tactical fight scenes where a character's positioning and surrounding environment factor into combat. While Fogent Roleplay combat can be run in the theater of the mind, it works even better on a battle map.
* **Dice Pool Scaling:** Fogent Roleplay wants players to feel like ever small improvement has a tangible impact. To this end, whenever possible we scale off the size of dice pools of the various skills a character has for just about everything. If your character has a big Athletics dice pool, they are really fast both in and out of combat. Did you just improve your magic skill, we'll now all your lower level spells just got slightly increased range, area of effect, uses per round, ect...
* **Pre-made Settings:** If you don't have the time to come up with an entire setting for your players to play in, Fogent Roleplay comes with pre-made campaign settings. This is an ongoing effort with more becoming available over time.
* **Mature Ruleset:** Fogent Roleplay provides a mature and robust ruleset with no mechanical edge cases (if you can find one, please let us know). Not only were the rules battle-tested via 100+ sessions durning it's development, most of the rules have been converted into code equivalent logic. Since the resulting software works, the rules are mechanically robust.

To close, Fogent Roleplay was born out of the frustration of other popular TTRPGs steadily increasing rule complexity just to have a reason to sell you stuff you didn't need and punishing creators who built content into their systems. However, many years into it's development now, is driven by the love of spending quality time with friends, collaboratively exploring our imaginations, and telling awesome stories.

Long live open-source fun,

-Javk "The Forever Narrator" Wick

## Dice Pool

A Dice Pool is a collection of dice that when rolled determines how many "wins" where achieved. D6 dice (otherwise known as six-sided dice) are the most common dice used, though D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are also used.

After the Dice Pool has been rolled, the amount of "wins" from the roll are counted. Any rolled dice that gets a 4 or greater counts as a win. D6 dice have a 50% chance of rolling a win, as 4, 5, and 6 on the D6 are wins. D4s only have a 25% chance of a win, since only the 4 on the dice counts as a win. In general, the more dice and the more faces the dice have, the better the chances are of getting more wins.

| Dice Type | Probability of Win |
| :-------: | :----------------: |
|    D4    |        25%        |
|    D6    |        50%        |
|    D8    |       62.5%       |
|    D10    |        70%        |
|    D12    |        75%        |
|    D20    |        85%        |

Base Dice make up that base of every Dice Pool. Base Dice are always represented by 3 dice. By default Base Dice start at Tier 0.

| Tier | Base Dice | Item Quality Description |
| :--: | :--------: | :----------------------: |
|  -3  |    3d4    |          Broken          |
|  -2  |  1d6, 2d4  |         Damaged         |
|  -1  |  2d6, 1d4  |          Shoddy          |
|  0  |    3d6    |         Mundane         |
|  1  |  1d8, 2d6  |         Quality         |
|  2  |  2d8, 1d6  |           Fine           |
|  3  |    3d8    |        Excellent        |
|  4  | 1d10, 2d8 |         Superior         |
|  5  | 2d10, 1d8 |        Exquisite        |
|  6  |    3d10    |         Flawless         |
|  7  | 1d12, 2d10 |       Mastercraft       |
|  8  | 2d12, 1d10 |          Fabled          |
|  9  |    3d12    |           Epic           |
|  10  | 1d20, 2d12 |        Legendary        |
|  11  | 2d20, 1d12 |          Mythic          |
|  12  |    3d20    |         Artifact         |

A Dice Pool may incur a penalty that removes dice. If so, first add up the Dice Pool without any of the penalties. Then, to remove dice, always remove the lowest-sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.

A "Standing Dice Pool" refers to a Dice Pool that has already rolled, where it results will "stand" within the narrative until the Narrator determines otherwise. The rolled Dice Pool shouldn't be altered until the Narrator determines otherwise, as it will be used determine multiple narrative outcomes. The same rules for removing dice apply to a Standing Dice Pool, however, when deciding which dice to remove of the same type, always remove dice from left to right. This is to leave it up to chance if the dice removed was a win or not. With physical dice, you can just roughly straighten out the dice and begin removing in that order.

## Challenge Level

Challenge Level represents the difficulty of a task set by the Narrator proportionate to an **AVERAGE PERSON OF THE WORLD**. If a character is able to get enough wins to match or exceed the Challenge Level, they succeed.

| Level |     Description     |
| :---: | :------------------: |
|   0   |       Trivial       |
|   1   |        Common        |
|   2   |       Uncommon       |
|   3   |     Specialized     |
|   4   |      Difficult      |
|   5   | Extremely Difficult |
|   6   |     Unrealistic     |
|   7   | Virtually Impossible |
|   8   |    Inconceivable    |
|   9   |      Legendary      |

Pay attention the description of each Challenge Level. They are intended help Narrators and Players both intuitively understand how hard something should be within the narrative of the story.

For example, Javk Wick the Rogue hoist his unconscious injured ally onto his shoulders to get them both to safety. The Narrator determines that picking up someones limp body and getting them to your shoulders is neither a "Trivial" or "Common" thing to do for the average person. The Narrator sets the Challenge Level at "Uncommon" (CL 2) using the Lift Skill. If the ally was instead conscious, the Narrator might only set the Challenge Level to "Common" (CL 1) as hoisting an unconscious limp body is far harder than a conscious compliant one.

## Attribute

An Attribute represent the innate characteristics of a character. Each level of an attribute corresponds with a narrative significance. Level 0 in an attribute should refer to an average person in the world.

| Level | Description |
| :---: | :---------: |
|  -2  | Negligible |
|  -1  |   Subpar   |
|   0   |   Average   |
|   1   |   Gifted   |
|   2   |    Elite    |
|   3   |    Super    |
|   4   | Demigodlike |
|   5   |   Godlike   |

### Strength (STR)

Represents a character's innate muscle strength, bone density, tendon strength, physical/bodily durability, etc...

| Attribute Level |                 Example                 |
| :-------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                A squirrel                |
|       -1       |             A feeble old man             |
|        0        |             An average human             |
|        1        |      Professional soldier or knight      |
|        2        | World's strongest man champion or Batman |
|        3        |      Bear, Ogre, or Captain America      |
|        4        |         Hercules, Hulk, or Thor         |
|        5        |                 Superman                 |

- A character with positive STR is more resistant/durable against physical/bodily damage types. In combat, for every positive point in STR a character can reduce a Victory Level achieved against them once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every positive point in STR a character can reduce an injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of downtime between each injury.
- A character with negative STR is less resistant/durable against physical/bodily damage types. In combat, for every negative point in STR the Narrator can increase a Victory Level achieved against them once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every negative point in STR the Narrator can increase an injury against a character as many times as they want.

### Reflex (RFX)

Represents a character's innate reflexes, reaction speed, nervous system, fine motor control, nimbleness, agility, quickness...

| Attribute Level |                      Example                      |
| :-------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                    A tortoise                    |
|       -1       |                  A slow old man                  |
|        0        |                 An average human                 |
|        1        | Professional thief, parkourist, or circus acrobat |
|        2        |    Gold medal gymnast or master martial artist    |
|        3        |                      Legolas                      |
|        4        |                     Spiderman                     |
|        5        |                The Flash or Hermes                |

- A character with higher RFX permanently gets higher priority in combat round turn order over character's with lower RFX.

### Intelligence (INT)

Represents a character's innate raw mental horsepower, IQ, consciousness, and mental/spiritual durability.

| Attribute Level |                                Example                                |
| :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                               A zombie                               |
|       -1       |                             A dog or cat                             |
|        0        |                           An average human                           |
|        1        |                     University science professor                     |
|        2        | Award-winning particle physicist or 'Sherlock Holmes' level detective |
|        3        |                              Tony Stark                              |
|        4        |                           Ultron or Skynet                           |
|        5        |                        Dr. Manhattan or Athena                        |

- Starting at level 0, for every increase/decrease in INT level a player character receives, they gain/lose skill points equal their new INT level. For example, a character who increases their INT from 0 to 1 would have gained skill point. If they then increased their INT to Level 2, they would gain 2 skill points, for a total of 3 gained skill points from their INT.
- A character with positive INT is more resistant/durable against psychic/spiritual damage types. In combat, for every positive point in INT a character can reduce a Victory Level achieved against them once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every positive point in INT a character can reduce an injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of downtime between each injury.
- A character with negative INT is less resistant/durable against psychic/spiritual damage types. In combat, for every negative point in INT the Narrator can increase a Victory Level achieved against them once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every negative point in INT the Narrator can increase an injury against a character as many times as they want.

### Charisma (CHA)

Represents a character's innate personal magnetism, persuasiveness, appearance, force of personality, social grace, and ability to lead and inspire others.

| Attribute Level |                              Example                              |
| :-------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                Social pariah or utterly repellent                |
|       -1       |             Awkward, easily ignored, or unconvincing             |
|        0        |                         An average human                         |
|        1        |  Influential leader or captivating performer (e.g., Cult Leader)  |
|        2        |    Nation-swaying icon or legendary diplomat (e.g., Cleopatra)    |
|        3        |   Supernatural allure or universally enchanting (e.g., Siren)   |
|        4        |  Demigod tier manipulator or reality-bending charm (e.g., Loki)  |
|        5        | Divine-level influence or irresistible presence (e.g., Aphrodite) |

* A character with positive CHA is more capable of leveraging their force of personality within social situations. For each level above 0 in CHA, a character can give themselves advantage once per day on a social skill check that has CHA as one of it's governing attributes.
* A character with negative CHA is less capable of leveraging their force of personality within social situations. For each level below 0 in CHA, the narrator can give a character disadvantageous per day on a social skill check that has CHA as one of it's governing attributes.

## Skill

A Skill represent certain tasks or actions a character can perform.

### Skill Level

Skill Level measures how good a character is at a specific skill.

| Level | Description |
| :---: | :---------: |
|  -1  | Incompetent |
|   0   |   Novice   |
|   1   | Apprentice |
|   2   |    Adept    |
|   3   |   Expert   |
|   4   |   Master   |
|   5   |   Legend   |

### Skill Dice Pool

The Dice Pool of a Skill is determined as follows:

- Base Dice, which are generally 3d6 but can vary based on Effects
- +1d6 for each increment in Skill Level above 0
- -1d for each decrement in Skill Level below if below 0
- +1d6 for each increment in a Governing Attribute Level above 0, assuming the Attribute governs the Skill
- -1d for each decrement in a Governing Attribute Level below 0, assuming the Attribute governs the Skill
- Plus/minus dice from any Effects that modify the Skill in question

### Collaboration Skill Check

Multiple characters may contribute to the same skill check. The Narrator should then evaluate the Challenge Level in the context of if multiple characters were performing it. All characters make their skill check, from which the average is taken, always rounding down to the nearest whole number. The average will then determine success or failure.

**Example:**

A character wants to pick up an entire large heavy treasure chest by themselves and take it up a flight of stairs.

The Narrator determines this a Specialized task (CL 3), not only for the weight of the chest but for how cumbersome it is for one person to move. The character gets 2 Wins on their Lift check. They are not able to get the chest up the stairs.

After a short rest, both the original character and one of there teammates decide to pick up the chest together. The Narrator assigns this a Common task (CL 1) since people do this every day. The two characters both roll their Lift check. One gets 2 wins and the other gets 1 win. The average is 1.5, which rounds down to 1. They can move the chest up the stairs.

## Core Skill

Core Skills are skills that cover the majority of what most creatures can perform.

**Name:** This is the name of the Core Skill.

**Governing Attributes:** The Attributes that govern the Core Skill in question. Generally Core Skill's will only be governed by one Attribute.

**Name:** This is the name of the Vocational Skill.

**Governing Attributes:** The Attributes that govern the Vocational Skill in question. A Vocational Skill can have one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it, which can differ from the Vocation's Governing Attributes.

In general, if it is logical that some change to an Attribute would meaningfully benefit/hurt the skill in question, than it should be added.

Vocational Skills can often resolve in a single roll what without it would turn into a sequence of possibly more difficult Core Skill checks, which opens up more possibilities for failure.

For example, a Warrior and Rogue are trying to pickpocket a letter from a courier. The Warrior wants to try first, so the Narrator has the Warrior describe how he will accomplish this. The Warrior first say he will try to determine the optimal spot along the courier's path to get close without raising suspicion, then he will roughly bump into the courier, help pick up the now scattered letters, then quickly pocket the letter in question before the courier can notice. The Narrator first asks the Warrior to make a series of checks starting with a Knowledge Check, and then a Dexterity check. If at any point during the checks, if the Warrior had failed a check his plan could've been ruined. However, if the Rogue has the Pickpocketing Vocational Skill, he would have had to only roll one check in a Skill he is likely more proficient at since he didn't have to invest into 2 different Skills.

When determining what a Vocational Skill's Governing Attributes would be, it is often handy to ask what sequence of Core Skills would be required to attempt the same thing. Based off what Core Skills a character would've had to performed, you can usually infer what Governing Attributes the Vocational Skill will have. Below are some examples of Vocational Skills for certain Vocations.

### Example of creating a Vocation

Let's make a Rogue vocation.

We set our "Rogue" Vocation Level to 2.

For the Governing Attributes of Rogue, we take RFX and INT as our vocation would benefit from us being dexterous and cunning.

We add "Lockpicking" as a Vocational Skill as it is something a Rogue would do. For it's Governing Attributes I give it RFX and INT, as being nimble with my fingers and understanding the mechanics of the lock would benefit this skill. We set the Skill Level to 2.

We add "Pickpocketing" as a Vocational Skill as it is something a Rogue would do. For it's Governing Attributes I give it RFX and INT as being nimble with my fingers and planning the perfect place to intercept the target would benefit this Skill. We set the Skill Level to 2.

We add "Infiltration Knowledge" as a Vocational Skill, as it is something a Rogue would do. For it's Governing Attributes, I give it just INT, as being more cunning would aid me as I lay out my plan. We set the Skill Level to 2.

We add "Close Melee" as a Vocational Skill, as using a knife or blackjack would be something a Rogue would do. For it's Governing Attributes, I give it STR, RFX, and INT, as being stronger, faster, and smarter would all benefit this skill. We set the Skill Level to 1.

Finally, I try to add "Fire Magic" as a Vocational Skill. After talking with the Narrator, we determine this is way outside of the scope of what a Rogue can do in their world. If we wanted a "Fire Magic" Vocational Skill, we'd have to spec into a Vocation like "Wizard" or "Mage".

Our character has 0 STR, 1 RFX, 1 INT, and 0 CHA.

|         Rogue         |   RFX, INT   | 2 | 7d6 |
| :--------------------: | :-----------: | :-: | :-: |
|      Lockpicking      |   RFX, INT   | 2 | 7d6 |
|     Pickpocketing     |   RFX, INT   | 2 | 7d6 |
| Infiltration Knowledge |      INT      | 2 | 6d6 |
|      Close Melee      | STR, RFX, INT | 1 | 7d6 |

## Tied Contested Checks

Contested Checks occur when two character's actions conflict. The most obvious example of this is fighting, though other examples include drinking contests, arm wrestling, or stealth vs perception.

When a Tied Contested Check occurs, neither side makes any progress and the contested check is a stalemate. If this contested check happens within a combat round, than the stalemate is only applicable on that round. After The Narrator has narratively described the stalemate if both sides initiate the contested check again, they roll off again.

Sometimes, a character might actually want a stalemate with neither side making progress. Here are some examples:

- If a character is fighting a foe they have no chance of handling on there own, a stalemate is good as just holding them off until backup arrives is the smart move.
- If a character is already successfully hidden from their opponent, then when their opponent tries to detect where they are hiding, a stalemate means they get to remain in stealth.
- If a character is trying to keep there eyes on an enemy trying to hidden, then when their opponent tries to hide, a stalemate means they can still see the opponent.

**Combat example 1:**

Two characters are in combat and roll their dice pools versus one another. Each of them gets 2 wins on their combat roll. They clash but aren't able to injure each other.

**Combat example 2:**

A rogue and a knight are fighting each other in combat. The rogue wants to use the dim light of the room to get around the knight and sneak attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contested check is a stalemate and the rogue is not able to enter into stealth. Looks like he'll have to fight him without the aid of the shadows this round.

**Combat example 3:**

A rogue and a knight are fighting each other in combat. The rogue has already used the dim light of the room to successfully hide behind some crates last round. The knight declares he is trying to find the rogue on his turn and attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contest check is a stalemate and the rogue remains hidden. The rogue uses his stealth to sneak attack the knight.

**Non-combat example:**

Outside of combat, a rogue is trying to sneak up on a knight. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The guard thinks to himself that maybe it was just the wind as he peers into the darkness. The rogue holds his breath, heart pounding as he tries to remain motionless. They reroll to determine a clear winner.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage and Disadvantage represent circumstances that favor or disfavor a character, resulting in better or worse odds of achieving wins on a Dice Pool roll.

**Advantage** is gained when circumstance favors a character. For any dice rolled, 3's count as wins for that roll.

**Disadvantage** is gained when circumstance disfavors a character. For any dice rolled, 4's count as failures for that roll.

**Super Advantage** is gained under very specific conditions when the stars have aligned for a character. For any dice rolled, 3s and 2s count as wins for that roll.

**Super Disadvantage** is gained under very specific conditions when a character has truly drawn the short straw. For any dice rolled, 4's and 5's count as failures for that roll.

Super Advantage/Disadvantage completely overrides Advantage and Disadvantage on any roll.

### Multiple Advantages and Disadvantages on a roll

For a given roll, one source of Advantage will cancel out with one source of Disadvantage, and vice versa.

If after canceling out Advantage and Disadvantage a character is left with neither Advantage or Disadvantage, then they would roll normally. Otherwise, if a character is left with one or multiple sources of Advantage, then they would roll with Advantage. Finally, if a character is left with one or multiple sources of Disadvantage, then they would roll with Disadvantage.

In the extreme case that a character has Super Advantage and Super Disadvantage, they cancel out the same way Advantage and Disadvantage do.

## Assists

With Assists, a character can give Advantage (or if rolled poorly, Disadvantage) with an "assisting" Dice Pool Skill Check to a "primary" Dice Pool Skill Check. Characters can Assist themselves or another character. The "assisting" Dice Pools must be rolled first.

It must make logical sense to the Narrator as to why the "assisting" Dice Pool would aid the "primary" Dice Pool. Player's should recognize when they are stretching logic and Narrators should recognize when the player's come up with creative applications of Assists. It's up to the players and the Narrator to explain/negotiate how these assists make logical sense for the current circumstance.

Assists can never use the same Skill for the "assisting" and "primary" Dice Pools. For instance, a character could never assist another character's Lift Check with their own Lift Check, they would instead use the Collaboration Skill Check rules.

Multiple characters can assist the same "primary" Dice Pool. If they are assisting using the same Skill their assists rolls will use the Collaboration Skill Check rules for that assist. If they are using different Skills as Assists, handle each assist roll separately before seeing if the resulting Advantages/Disadvantages cancel out, with whatever remains being applied to the "primary" Dice Pool.

**The CL for Assists starts at CL 3 and should RARELY be lower than that.** However, it is up to the Narrator to decide if it should be higher than CL 3. In general, most Assists, unless extremely unlikely to aid the current situation, will be made at CL 3.

If the "assisting" Dice Pool achieved more wins than the Assist CL, Advantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool. If the "assisting" Dice Pool achieved Wins equal to the Assist CL, neither Advantage or Disadvantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool. If the Assist check achieved fewer wins than the Assists CL, Disadvantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool.

**Example 1:**

Thrak the Barbarian is trying to lift a big rock. Bob the Bard decides he is going to play some motivational music on his guitar to Assist Thrak. In this example, Thrak's Lift is the "primary" Dice Pool and Bob's Performance Vocational Skill is the "assisting" Dice Pool.

The Narrator agrees as it makes logical sense. The Narrator sets a CL 3 Performance Check for the Assists. Bob rolls his Performance Vocational skill and gets 4 wins, resulting in Advantage for Thrak's Lift Check. In a parallel reality, Bob only gets 3 wins, and his song doesn't help or hurt Thrak's Check. In another parallel reality, Bob only gets 2 wins on his Performance Check, which produces such horrible music it distracts Thrak resulting in Disadvantage to Thrak's Lift Check.

**Example 2:**

Javk Wick the rogue is sneak his way into a guarded castle. Javk's player asks the Narrator if he could assist his Stealth check to sneak up with his Infiltration Knowledge Vocational Skill. In this example, Stealth is the "primary" Dice Pool and Infiltration Knowledge is the "assisting" Dice Pool.

The Narrator agrees as it makes logical sense. The Narrator sets the CL of the Assist at 3. Javk gets 4 Wins from his Assist, giving him advantage on his Stealth check.

**Example 3:**

Javk Wick the rogue is in combat. Javk and his enemy are in melee combat and the ground is covered in oil. The Narrator declares that anyone standing in the slick oil has Disadvantage on their combat roll. Javk's player asks the Narrator if he could Assist his combat roll with his dagger with Dexterity. Javk's player wants to use his character's balance and fancy foot work to nullify the Disadvantage from the slippery oil.

The Narrator agrees, setting the Assist to CL 3 due to the slippery oil patches cover the floor. Javk gets 4 Wins from his Assist, giving him advantage on his dagger's combat roll. The Advantage and Disadvantage cancel out leaving him with a normal roll.

## The Fate Roll

The Fate Roll can be used by the Narrator to let the roll of a dice decide what direction the story will move in, be that for or against the goals and desires of the players.

A Fate Roll is made with a D20 and is made by the Narrator or designated to a Player by the Narrator. The higher the roll is, the better the result is for the players. Rolling a 20 is considered a critical success, and may allow the Narrator to assign exceptionally advantageous circumstances to the players. The lower the roll is, the worse the result is for the players. Rolling a 1 is always to be considered a critical failure, and will result in an extremely unfavorable outcome for the players. Whether they be revealed as immediate or delayed consequences is up to the Narrator.

These rolls may be used in situations of great intensity to help the Narrator guide the path of the action. They may be used to help break up monotony at random times to see if something good or bad occurs or even what the weather is.

## Damage Types

Damage Types represent the various sources of injuries a character can receive.

**Name:** The name of the Damage Type.

**Description:** A brief description of the Damage Type.

**Optional Defending Skill:** The Skill that directly defends against the Damage Type. If it is "None", than no skill directly defends against the Damage Type.

## Unit of Measure

This section defines the different units of measure that a game will use.

| Length | Area | Volume | Weight | Angle |
| :----: | ---- | :----: | :----: | :---: |
|   ft   | ft^2 |  ft^3  |   lb   |  °  |

### Using a Battle Map

When using a grid Battle Map for combat, it is important to inform your players the dimensions of each part of the grid. For instance, most grided battle maps have each square represent a 5 ft x 5 ft square.

## Range

A Range specifies at what distance an action can be performed. The Min Range specifies the shortest distance the Range covers. The Max Range specifies the furthest distance the Range covers.

Min Range = (Min Range Base) + ((Size of governing Skill Dice Pool) * (Min Range Per Dice))

Max Range = (Max Range Base) + ((Size of governing Skill Dice Pool) * (Max Range Per Dice))

The result of calculating a range can be written as "(Range Name): (Min Range) - (Max Range) (Length Unit of Measure)", for example "Melee: 0 - 5 ft".

If a Range specifies "(Normal)" as part of it's name, than the Dice Pool rolled for the action will do so normally. If "(Disadvantage)" is specified than the Dice Pool rolled for the action does so at Disadvantage. If "(Super Disadvantage)" is specified than the Dice Pool rolled for the action does so at Super Disadvantage.

Often, an action will have multiple Ranges, usually done to denote different behavior. If the Ranges overlap each other, than the most advantageous Range can be used.

**Name:** The name of the range.

**Min Range Base:** The base amount for the Min Range.

**Min Range Per Dice:** The amount of additional Min Range per dice in the governing Skill's Dice Pool.

**Max Range Base:** The base amount for the Max Range.

**Max Range Base:** The amount of additional Max Range per dice in the governing Skill's Dice Pool.

### Example

A character is trying to determine how far away they can shoot their fireball spell. It has the Ranges "Long (Normal), Long (Disadvantage), Long (Super Disadvantage)". The governing Skill's Dice Pool is 7d6.

We'd calculate the "Long (Normal)" Range as follows. It's Min Range would 0 + (7 * 0) = 0. It's Max Range would be 0 + (7 * 20) = 140. So the result would be "Long (Normal): 0 - 140 ft".

The final result of all of the Ranges would be "Long (Normal): 0 - 140 ft, Long (Disadvantage): 140 - 280 ft, Long (Super Disadvantage): 280 - 420 ft". Since "Long (Normal)" and "Long (Disadvantage)" overlap at 140 ft, if a target were engaged at that distance than we'd use "Long (Normal)" since it is the most advantageous.

## Area Of Effect

An Area Of Effect describes a 3D space. They can be used to describe any action that will cover a chunk of space, often used for certain attacks such as an explosions.

All Area Of Effects will have a point of origin from which they will emanate from. This will vary based on the different shapes of the Area of Effects.

If an Area Of Effect specifies "(Disadvantage)", "(Super Disadvantage)", "(Advantage)", or "(Super Disadvantage)" as part of it's name than the Dice Pool that will be rolled for that action will gain the corresponding option from the "Advantage and Disadvantage" rules section.

Often, an action will have multiple Area Of Effects, such as when trying to add gradations of effectiveness to some action.

For example let's say we want to add gradations to how effective a modern hand grenade is. We will use 3 nested Spheres. The inner most Area Of Effect Sphere will represent the "kill radius" for our explosion, so we'll specify "(Normal)" in it's name. The middle Area Of Effect Sphere will represent the "casualty radius" where your more likely to get injured than die, so we'll specify "(Disadvantage)" in it's name. The outer most Sphere will represent where you'd be mostly safe but might catch a unlucky piece of shrapnel, so we'll specify "(Super Disadvantage)" on it's name. So our grenade action's Area Of Effects would be "Grenade Explosion (Normal), Grenade Explosion (Disadvantage), Grenade Explosion (Super Disadvantage)".

If Area Of Effects from an action overlap each other, than the most advantageous Area Of Effects can be used.

Area Of Effects with a "... Per Dice" column can scales with the size of the Governing Skill Dice Pool. For example, this could be used for a magic users to have the size of their area of effects scaling with their proficiency with their magic.

### Box

### Cone

Point of Origin: A Cone point of origin will be the narrowest point of the cone, from which it will emanate out from.

If a cone has an angle of 53.13 degrees, than the cone's width is equal to its length at any given point. which means that the cone's area of effect is specified by its maximum length. For example, a cone spell with a range of 15 ft will extend up to 15 ft away from the point of origin, and at any point, its width matches its length.

|          Name          | Angle | Length Base | Length Per Dice |
| :---------------------: | :---: | :---------: | :-------------: |
|       10 ft Cone       | 53.13 |     10     |        0        |

### Range and Area Of Effects

If an action, such as an attack or spell, has a Range and an Area Of Effect, then the Range describe how far away the point of origin can be for the Area Of Effect.

When cases arise were an action is performed with a combination of a Range with Advantage/Disadvantage and Area Of Effect with Advantage/Disadvantage, simply use the "Multiple Advantages and Disadvantages on a roll" rule.

## Uses Per Round

Uses Per Round represent the number of times an action can be preformed during a round. Taking firearms as an example, the faster the fire rate and easier it is to reload, the better it's Uses Per Round should be. A flintlock pistol should have a far slower Uses Per Round as compared to a semi-automatic pistol.

If a character completely depletes their Uses Per Round for a combat round they can no longer use their Combat Roll for that combat round and are instead forced to use an Evasion Roll if they are being engaged.

If Optional Max is a number than it describes an upper bound for the Uses Per Round's calculation result. If it's "None" than there is no upper bound.

Uses Per Round = (Uses Per Round Base) + ( (Uses Per Round Per Dice) * (Size of governing Skill Dice Pool) )

Dice Per Uses Per Round is just a column used to give an approximation for how many dice are required to reach the next whole number for a Uses Per Round.

#### Uses Per Round result greater than 1 with decimals

If Uses Per Round is greater than 1 and has a decimal, round down to the nearest whole number.

#### Uses Per Round result less than 1

On a round where an action IS prepared (example: your Heavy Crossbow is loaded), you can perform the action 1 time.

On a round where an action is NOT prepared (example: your Heavy Crossbow is unloaded), if the Uses Per Round calculation result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than 1, 1 round must be spend preparing in order to use this action again. If the result is greater than 0 and less 0.5, your character must spend 2 rounds preparing.

While preparing the "Off Guard" Combat Modifier is gained. If engaged during this time characters can still attempt to perform an Evasion Roll.

#### Uses Per Round if character is using multiple loaded weapons

If characters have loaded weapons (for instance loaded muzzle loading firearms) within easy access, they can forgo loading, and use a faster Uses Per Round type that the Narrator decides. For instance, for muzzle loading pistols being drawn from a chest rig, "Swift" seems like a reasonable Uses Per Round type.

#### Example

Let's say a character's Uses Per Round for their Combat Roll is "Quick". The governing Skill Dice Pool for said Combat Roll is 7d6.

0 + ( 0.34 * 7 ) = 2.38

Optional Max is "None", so there is no upper bound. We round down 2.38 to 2. Therefore the character would have 2 Uses Per Round for that round.

## Destiny Points

A Destiny Point represents a player's ability to tip the scales of fate in favor of their character.

Destiny Point Effects are for the following two kinds of characters:

- Player Characters are given "Destiny Points" and "Destiny Resistance" by default. "Destiny Points" allows players to influence the story at key moments they decide. "Destiny Resistance" is mainly to prevent Player Characters from wasting all there Destiny Points against one another on silly rolls.
- Villain/Boss NPC can be given different combinations of these effects to dramatically increase how dangerous they are. Nothing scares players quite like telling them Destiny Points don't work versus a powerful foe...

Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the Narrator wants to encourage.

|   Destiny Points   | (0/3) A character can hold a max of 3 Destiny Points. Spending a "Preemptive Destiny Point" before rolling a dice pool gives Advantage on the resulting roll. Spending "Post Roll Destiny Points" adds additional Wins for each point spent, with the total Wins never exceeding the size of the dice pool. Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the Narrator wants to encourage. Examples include showing up to the game on time, exceptional roleplay, accomplishing a narrative milestone, and doing something in line with their character's personality even if at the detriment of wealth or progress. |          | The Narrator |

## Effects

An Effect simply describes some way a character or item could have an effect on the narrative. Effects can be placed on characters or items.

All effect have a "Name", "Description", "Duration", and "Source" though they may have additional fields beyond these.

**Name:** The name of the Effect.

**Description:** Describes what the Effect is doing narratively.

**Duration:** Describes how long the Effect itself will be active.

**Source:** Describes where the effect came from. If the Effect is innate to the character, such as using their bare hands as weapons, use "Innate". If an Effect is coming from an item, such as a magic ring, use the name of the item. If from so 4th wall breaking source, such as special Effects only given to players, use "The Narrator".

## Attribute Dice Mod Effect

An Attribute Dice Mod adds or subtracts dice for Dice Pools if they governed by at least one of the Attributes specified.

**Affected Attributes:** If any skill is governed by at least one of the attribute listed, than apply the Dice Pool Modifier to that Skill's Dice Pool.

**Dice Pool Modifier:** The Dice Pool Modifier that will be applied to a Dice Pool.

### Injury

Injury is handled as part of the narrative with dice penalties being applied per injury to a character's dice checks.

Typical "status effects" such as being poisoned, frostbitten, bleeding, madness, etc... are handled elegantly through the injury system. For instance, if you were dealt a Serious Injury by mild poison mist, then narratively explain it as getting a large breath full. If the character instead was dealt a Serious injury by an extremely lethal poison mist, then narratively it would be explained as only getting a small whiff. The resulting dice penalty acts as your "status effect" debuffing your character until they are resolved. For instance, anti-venom might be able to remove the poison injury or warming up by a fire might reduce hypothermia from the cold.

### Weight Class

Weight Class represent the physical strain of carrying equipment. Some characters will purposefully be in a higher weight class to gain the benefits of heavier armor and weapons, making up for their Carry weight penalty with better gear.

## Defense Effect

Defense is used to reduce incoming injuries from Damage Types by the equivalent amount of Defense against it. If a character has multiple Defenses, then add the values of the Defenses together for each Damage Type to get their Total Defense. If a totaled Defense to a specific Damage Type has a decimal place remainder, you'll round it down to the nearest whole number when reducing an injury with it.

If a foe has a sufficiently high Defense to a certain Damage Type, then the best course of action is to circumvent it. For instance, a knight in full plate armor would be extremely difficult to injury from injuries caused by the Slash Damage Type. In these circumstances, the most efficient way of defeating a character in heavy armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life. Another option is to use an attack with a different Damage Type, such as spraying poison mist at them, to completely circumvent there high Slash defense.

### Defending Skill

When a character is taking an injury from a Damage Type that has a Defending Skill, the can add the wins gained from their Defending Skill's Dice Pool to their Defense.

The character can choose to take the static amount of wins or roll.

**Static Wins:** For the Defending Skill, take the size of the Dice Pool, divide it by 2, and then round down to the nearst whole number.

**Rolled Wins:** The wins achieved by rolling the Defending Skill's Dice Pool count as count as Defense.

If in combat, the amount of wins gained from a Defending Skill remain for an entire round.

#### Example

A character takes a Serious Injury (level 3) from a poison spray. The Poison Damge Type's' Defending Skill is "Endurance". The character's Endurance Dice Pool is "5d6".

**Choosing the Static Wins:** If the character takes the static wins, they have 2.5 wins. That means they are able to scale down the injury to a Minor Injury (level 1).

**Choosing to Roll for Wins:** If the character wants to roll, they have the chance of negating the injury completely. If they rolled and got 3 wins, they would completely resist the injury. However, if they for instance only got 1 win, they would take a Medium Injury (level 2).

### Armor

Most Armor has a Defense. For item creation purposes, determining what portions a piece of armor will protect is useful.

- Head Armor
- Body Armor
- Arm Armor
- Leg Armor
- Shield

A character can wear two pieces of armor on the same body part, such as wearing a gambeson shirt under chain mail shirt or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history.

### Shields

Shields generally takes up one of the character's hands when in use. Characters not actively using their shield do not benefit from the additional defense.

### Defending against Injury with multiple Damage Types

In the rare case were a character is having to defend from an injury coming from multiple Damage Types, the Narrator can decide to use 1 of the 2 following rules:

1) The defending character can average add all the Defense's against the Damage Types in question, then divide by the number of Damage Types. The result can act as the Defense against the incoming attack.
2) The attacking character has to choose which Damage Type is primary, which the defender will be able to defend against.

## Resource Pool Max Calculation

A Resource Pool Max Calculation can be used to determine the maximum amount a Resource Pool can hold.

Governing Skill Resource Pool Max Result = ( (Skill Level) * (Skill Dice Pool Size) ) / 2, rounded down to the nearest whole number

- If the Skill's level is 0 or below, then use 0.5 for the "(Skill Level)" variable in the above calculation and round down to the nearest whole number.

Governing Vocation Resource Pool Max Result = (Vocation Level) * (Vocation Dice Pool Size)

- If the Vocation's level is 0 then use 0.5 for the "(Vocation Level)" variable in the calculation above and round down to the nearest whole number.

Resource Pool Max Calculation Result = (Base Amount) + (Governing Vocation Resource Pool Max Result) + (Governing Skill Resource Pool Max Result)

**Name:** The name of the Resource Pool Max Calculation

**Optional Governing Skill Name:** If "None" than the "(Skill Dice Pool Size)" is 0. Otherwise, represent the Skill who's Dice Pool Size will be used in the calculation.

**Optional Governing Vocation Name:** If "None" than the "(Vocation Dice Pool Size)" is 0. Otherwise, represent the Vocation who's Dice Pool Size will be used in the calculation.

## Resource Pool Effect

Represents a pool of resources which can represent whatever a the Narrator desires. Examples include a pool of mana for powering magic, ammo for weapons, Destiny Points, ect...

**Resource:** Describes the individual thing the Resource Pool is made up of.

**Amount:** This is the starting amount of resource.

**Optional Resource Pool Max:** If "None", than there is no maximum amount of resource for the Resource Pool. Otherwise, if it's the Name of a Resource Pool Max Calculation than the result of the calculation will act as the maximum value. Lastly, if it's a number than it signifies the maximum amount of resource the Resource Pool can hold.

**Is Amount Tied to Item Stack Quantity:** If "TRUE" than Item Stack the Resource Pool Effect is placed on is considered to be the same. Meaning that the Amount of the Resource Pool and Quantity of the Item Stack should be the same.

|               Destiny Point Pool               | A character can hold a max of 3 Destiny Points. Spending a "Preemptive Destiny Point" before rolling a dice pool gives Advantage on the resulting roll. Spending "Post Roll Destiny Points" adds additional Wins for each point spent, with the total Wins never exceeding the size of the dice pool. Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the narrator wants to encourage. Examples include showing up to the game on time, exceptional roleplay, accomplishing a narrative milestone, and doing something in line with their character's personality even if at the detriment of wealth or progress. | Indefinite | Given by The Narrator |         Destiny Point         |   0   |                  3                  |                 FALSE                 |

## Combat Roll Effect

Represents how a character is performing combat. A Combat Roll could represent swinging a greatsword with both hands, dual-wielding pistols, throwing a javelin, ect...

**Name:** The name of a Combat Roll is conventionally formatted the following way: "(Variation) (Type) with (Resource)". This isn't required but helps to keep things consistent.

**Variation:** Used to represents the different ways the Combat Roll is being used. Generally, it describes how a character's hands (or other appendages) will be occupied as part of the Combat Roll. This is important when defining a Combat Roll, as some weapons would be impossible to use with one hand (such as a bow). "One-handed" denotes only one hand is being used which frees up the other hand to hold a shield, a light source, an important item, etc... "Two-handed" denotes two hands are being used meaning both their hands are required. "Dual-wielded" denotes a hand is being used on a main weapon with the other hand is being used on another off hand weapon. Dual-wielding is only for attacks/weapons that wouldn't encumber the user if one were held in each hand.

**Type:** Describes what type of the Combat Roll.

**Optional Resource And Amount:** If "None", then the Combat Roll requires no Resource for use. Otherwise it denotes the Resource and amount consumed per use of the Combat Roll. See the Resource Pool rules for more details.

**Base Dice Adjustment:** Adjusts the tier of the Base Dice for the Combat Roll's Dice Pool. This generally is used to adjust the consistency and reliability of the Combat Roll. Making a new version of a Combat Roll by giving a small improvement to it's Base Dice Adjustment is a great way to make unique weapons, to allow characters to upgrade their equipment, or to represent higher quality ammo.

**Dice Pool Modifier:** Represent either an addition or subtraction of dice to the Combat Roll Dice Pool. Used to represent how significant of a force multiplier a Combat Roll is. The more effective the Combat Roll, the larger the dice pool modification. For example, a bomb arrow is significantly more dangerous than a conventional arrow, so it would receive additional dice.

**Penetration:** Penetration represents a dealt injuries ability to mitigate the opponent's Defense. While dealing an injury, you may reduce your opponent's Totaled Defense by your Combat Roll's Penetration before calculating injury.

Examples of narratively describing better penetration:

- Firearm vs Firearm loaded with armor piercing bullets.
- Poison shot vs poison aerosolized spray, making it far more likely to penetrate the bodies natural defenses.
- Arming Sword swing vs Great Sword swing, which just give you more leverage and mass because if you can't cut through at least you'll crunch what's underneath.

**Ranges:** The Ranges the action can be performed at. See the Range rules for more details.

**Uses Per Round:** The amount of times the Combat Roll can be used during a combat round. See the Uses Per Round rules for more details.

**Optional Area Of Effect:** If "None" than there is no Area Of Effect. Otherwise The shape and dimensions the Combat Roll creates when used. See the Area Of Effect rules for more details.

**Damage Types:** The types of damage a weapon inflicts when dealing injuries.

**Governing Skill Name:** The Skill that governs the Combat Roll.

**Description:** A description of the Combat Roll. Addition features specific to the Combat Roll will be included here, such as being usable while grappled or restricted in confined spaces.

**Duration:** Describes how long the Combat Roll effect is usable for. For most conventional weapons, this is "Indefinite".

**Source:** Describes where this Combat Roll is coming from. If it is coming from an item the character possess, than the name of the item would be used. If the Combat Roll is innate to the character, such as claws, than the source would be "Innate".

### Combat Roll Dice Pool

Used to determine a character's effectiveness in combat.

To calculated a Combat Roll's Dice Pool start with the Governing Skill's Dice Pool. Next, adjust it's Base Dice by the Combat Roll's Base Dice Adjustment. Finally, modify the resulting Dice Pool from the previous step by the Combat Roll's Dice Pool Modifier.

**Example**

Javk Wick the Rogue has two daggers he's dual-wielding. He wants to calculate the "Dual-wielded Slash Close Melee" Combat Roll his dagger's allow him to perform. First, we start with determining what the Governing Skill is for "Dual-wielded Slash Close Melee" which is "Close Melee". Next, we determine that Javk's "Close Melee" Dice Pool is 6d6. Then, we adjust the tier of the Base Dice by the Combat Roll's Base Dice Adjustment which takes us from tier 0 (3d6) to tier 1 (1d8, 2d6), meaning the resulting Dice Pool is now "1d8, 5d6". Finally, we modify "1d8, 5d6" by the Combat Roll's Dice Pool Modifier of "+1d6" resulting in a "1d8, 6d6" Dice Pool for our Combat Roll.

#### Combat Modifier

Combat Modifiers represent different circumstances that can occur within combat.

Cover: There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

#### Victory Level

- Victory Levels from Physical or Bodily damage can be reduced equal to the amount of STR a character has per combat encounter. If STR is negative, the level of Victory increases by 1.
- Victory levels from Mental or Soul damage can be reduced equal to the amount of INT a character has per combat encounter. If INT is negative, the level of Victory increases by 1.
- Any combination of lower Victory Level outcomes is possible as long as they sum up to be less than or equal to the Victory Level achieved. For instance, with a Level 2 victory, a character could perform both a Stagger and a Minor Injury against there opponent.
- It is mandatory that that the player dealing the Victory Level outcome must describe in awesome detail how they are performing this action. Creativity is encouraged!

|         Victory Level 1: Shove         |                                                      The opponent is shoved in the desired direction. The character performing the shove can either roll a Lift check or take the average amount of Wins rounded down. If the character is using magic, they may use a Magic Skill instead of Lift, assuming the magic could shove someone. For each win achieved, the character can shove another character 5 feet in a straight line. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance. For each size category, the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. The Narrator can change the shove distance based on unusual circumstances (i.e. humanoid-sized creature weighs as much as a Large sized creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).                                                      | Instant | 1 Victory Level win |

|          Victory Level 1: Drag          | The opponent, which first must be Grappled, is dragged in a desired direction. The character performing the drag can either roll a Lift check or take the average amount of wins rounded down. If the character is using magic, they may use a Magic Skill instead of Lift, assuming the magic could drag someone. For each win achieved, a character can drag another character 10 feet. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance. For each Size the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. If the character is required to move during the drag, they may not exceed their Movement Speed for that round.

## Carry Weight Effect

Carry Weight represents a character's ability to carry heavier equipment while still being able to move semi-normally.

It is important to note that when performing the Max Carry Weight calculation below, the Governing Skill Dice Pool should ignore any Attribute Dice Mod Effects that were gained from Carry Weight Effects. That is to say when determining "(Size of Governing Dice Pool)", disregard any Attribute Dice Mod Effects that comes from Carry Weight Effects.

Max Carry Weight = (Max Carry Weight Base) + ( (Size of Governing Dice Pool) * (Max Carry Weight Per Dice) )

**Governing Skill Name:** The name of the skill whose dice pool size you will use to calculate Max Carry Weight.

**Max Carry Weight Base:** The base amount of Max Carry Weight for the calculation.

**Max Carry Weight Per Dice:** The amount of additional Max Carry Weight per dice in the governing skill's dice pool.

**Weight Classes:** For a Carry Weight Effect, Weight Classes represent the "classes" a character falls into depending on the percentage of their Max Carry Weight they are currently carrying. If the weight a character is carrying divided by their Max Carry Weight is greater than "Optional Bottom Percent" and less than or equal to "Optional Top Percent", than that is the character's Weight Class. If either "Optional Bottom Percent" or "Optional Top Percent" are "None", than they are not used in the above determination. This can be used to describe the lower or upper bond Weight Classes.

|     Name     | Optional Bottom Percent | Optional Top Percent | Attribute Dice Mod Effect |
| :----------: | :---------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------------: |
|    Light    |          None          |         25.0         |    Weight Class: Light    |
|    Medium    |          25.0          |         50.0         |    Weight Class: Medium    |
|    Heavy    |          50.0          |         75.0         |    Weight Class: Heavy    |
|  Very Heavy  |          75.0          |        100.0        |  Weight Class: Very Heavy  |
| Overburdened |          100.0          |         None         | Weight Class: Overburdened |

If a character is in a certain Weight Class than the Attribute Dice Mod Effect that associated with it will be applied to the character.

Each Attribute Dice Mod Effect will almost always effect the same Attributes that Movement Speed relies on, meaning a heavier Weight Class will slow a character's Movement Speed.

|         Name         |       Description       |  Duration  | Source | Governing Skill Name | Max Carry Weight Base | Max Carry Weight Per Dice |           Weight Classes           |
| :-------------------: | :---------------------: | :--------: | :----: | :------------------: | :-------------------: | :-----------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| Humanoid Carry Weight | This is the description | Indefinite | Innate |         Lift         |           0           |            50            | Light, Medium, Heavy, Overburdened |

**Example:**

Let's say a character has the "Humanoid Carry Weight", Lift Skill Dice Pool of "3d6", and 30 lbs of equipment on them.

First we calculate the Max Carry Weight, which would be ((3 * 50) + 0) = 150.

Next, we need to determine what percentage of the character's Max Carry Weight their equipment currently is taking up, which would be (30 / 150) = 20%.

Therefore, since 20% is less than or equal to 25.0%, the character would have a Weight Class of "Light", which would apply the "Weight Class: Light" Attribute Dice Mod Effect.

## Currency

## Container Effect

Pouches, satchel, sacks, backpacks, chest, etc... are all consider containers. Each container can hold a certain amount of weight and/or volume within.

**Optional Weight Capacity:** The weight the container is capable of holding. If "None", than it has unlimited capacity for weight.

**Optional Volume Capacity:** The volume the container is capable of holding. If "None", than it has unlimited capacity for volume.

**Weightless Contents:** If false, then the contents of this container would be included in it's' total weight, such as a mundane backpack. If true, then then the contents of this container wouldn't be included in the total weight, such as a bag of holding were it's contents are stored in a pocket dimension.

When representing the contents of a container on a character sheet, a similar table as the one below is used.

**Backpack - 30 lb container:**

| ------------- | :-: | :----------------: | :--: | :---: | ----------- |

Characters will often stash or drop containers during combat as to not be in a heavier Weight Class. This is perfectly acceptable, but it is within the Narrators right to treat these items as fair game to be swiped by the enemy if an opportunity arises, however this might effect their Weight Class as well. Character's wishing to avoid a having their loot stolen can keep it on their backs, by a mount to stash it on, increase their equipment weight, etc...

## Movement Speed Effect

Movement Speed is used in Combat Rounds to determine how far a character can move.

Governing Skill And Movement Speed Per Dice Pair Result = (Size of Governing Dice Pool) * (Movement Speed Per Dice)

Movement Speed = (Movement Speed Base) + (#1 Governing Skill And Movement Speed Per Dice Pair Result) + (#2 Governing Skill And Movement Speed Per Dice Pair Result) + ect...

**Movement Speed Base:** The base amount of Movement Speed for the Movement Speed Calculation.

**Governing Skill And Movement Speed Per Dice Pairs:** Represents pairs of a Governing Skill and the amount of Movement Speed gained per the size of the Governing Skill's Dice Pool.

### Difficult Terrain

Steep mountains, ice-covered ground, swamps, etc. are difficult terrain. It takes twice the movement to move through these terrains.

### Dexterity Movement Speed

Dexterity Movement Speed is the initial portion of a character's movement and represents how quick they are to get into motion and act.

This can allow them to disengage from opponents, slip behind a door before it closes, avoid an Area Of Effect they are about to be caught in, close the distance to an opponent, ect...

While lower Dexterity Movement Speed characters are deciding what to do, high Dexterity Movement Speed characters are already in motion.

Dexterity Movement Speed can be used to resolve circumstances when it is unclear which character moved first or closed some distance. Dexterity Movement Speed is used first on a character's turn, with lower Dexterity Movement Speed characters considered to have not moved/acted yet.

**Example 1:**

A Rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an archer who is 5 feet away.

Their respective Dexterity Movement Speeds are 15 ft for the Rogue and 10 ft for the Archer.

The Archer declares he is going to shoot the Rogue with his bow as he uses his Movement Speed to stay out of range of the knife.

The rogue declares he is going to close the distance, attack with the knife, and stay on the archer. If the Rogue pulls this off, it will be disadvantageous for the archer since melee versus ranged combat in close quarters favors melee attacks.

Since the Rogue has 5 ft more Dexterity Movement Speed, he can move those 5 feet before the archer can lose the arrow, closing the distance. Now they will make combat rolls versus one another, with the Archer being at a clear disadvantage.

The Archer, now likely wounded from the Rogue's knife, tries to use the rest of his Movement Speed to stay out of range from the Rogue's knife. Assuming the Rogue has the same or greater remaining movement speed as the Archer, the Rogue stays on the Archer and the gap is 0 feet, ready to stab him again next round.

**Example 2:**

A Rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an Archer who is 15 feet away.

Their respective Dexterity Movement Speeds are 15 ft for the Rogue and 10 ft for the Archer.

The Archer declares he is going to shoot the Rogue with his bow as he uses his Movement Speed to stay out of range of the knife.

The Rogue declares he is going to close the distance, attack with his knife, and stay close to the Archer. If the Rogue pulls this off, it will be disadvantageous for the Archer since melee versus ranged combat in close quarters favors melee attacks.

Since the Rogue has 5 ft more Dexterity Movement Speed, he can move those 5 feet before the archer can lose the arrow, closing the distance. With 10 feet between the Rogue and the Archer, the arrow is shot. The Rogue must now try and dodge the arrow, before he can attack, possibly proving fatal.

The Archer is then able to flee backward. Assuming he has the same or greater remaining movement speed than the possibly injured Rogue, the Archer can keep the 10 feet of distance between him and the rogue, never getting stabbed.

**Example 3:**

A Rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an Knight who is 5 feet away standing in some slippery mud. The Knight is right on the edge of the mud pool, and the Rogue realizes if he can attack the Knight while he's standing in the mud, he has a better chance of defeating him.

Their respective Dexterity Movement Speeds are 10 feet for the Rogue and 5 feet for the Knight.

The Knight declares he is going to move forward out of the mud and swing on the Rogue with his longsword.

The Rogue declares he is going to close the distance before the Knight moves out of the mud and try to stab the Knight.

Since the Rogue has a higher Dexterity Movement Speeds, he can move 5 feet with his Dexterity Movement Speed before the Knight can move, closing the gap.

Since the Knight already had his sword ready to go, combat rolls will be made, but the Knight will do so while having to deal with the disadvantageous position being in slippery mud.

### Athletics Movement Speed

Athletics Movement Speed is the second portion of a character's movement and represents how fast they are once at there top speed.

Athletics Movement Speed should always make up a far greater amount of your Total Movement Speed as compared to Dexterity Movement Speed. Even though characters with higher Dexterity Movement Speed might be quicker to initially move, there is nothing prevent a high Athletics Movement Speed character from running them down.

Unlike Dexterity Speed, were the character with the greater speed can move before the other character, for Athletics Movement Speed both characters start moving at the same time.

### Total Movement Speed

Total Movement Speed is the combination of a character's Dexterity and Athletics Movement Speeds for a entire round. Therefore, a character can use both there Dexterity Movement Speed and Athletics Movement Speed during a round.

### Using multiple Movement Speeds on the same round

Whenever a character needs to use multiple movement speeds in a round, calculate what percentage of their movement they've used that round for their initial movement, with the remainder percent being used for another movement speed.

For example, if a character has 30 feet of "Terrestrial" and 15 feet of "Climb Combat Speed". The character walks 15 feet up to a climbable rock face. They've used 50% (15/30 = 0.5) of their movement speed, leaving them 50% of their climb combat speed. 50% of 15 feet is 7.5 feet. Therefore the character can climb 7.5 feet up the rock face.

### Mounted Movement Speed

The rider's Dexterity dice pool size is used for the mounts Dexterity Movement Speed calculation. Additionally, when a mounted character or their mount takes an injury in combat, a Dexterity or Riding skill check equivalent to the injury level must be succeeded to stay on horseback, or else they are knocked off.

## Set Attribute Level Effect

Sets a specified Attribute of a character to a new value. If the character's innate Attribute is greater than or equal to the new value, no change occurs.

| Super Strength | Strength set to level 4. | Indefinite |        |
|  Super Reflex  |  Reflex set to level 4.  | Indefinite |        |

## Set Skill Level Effect

Sets a specified Skill/Vocation of a character to a new value. If the character's innate Skill/Vocation is greater than or equal to the new value, no change occurs.

The character charging must move in a straight line, and once a charge is initiated as a portion of a character's movement, their directions must remain constant the entire round.

Character gains Advantage versus charging opponents and charging opponents lose their Advantage versus them. No movement can be used while bracing. Bracing uses the opponent's momentum against them, enabling a prepared defender to more easily stagger, trip or injure the charging opponent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |          1 Round          | Innate |     ~seconds     |         Lift         |        3        |             None             |                                   None                                   |           None           |

The hologram will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. When physically interacted with, the hologram is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the image, it may discern that it is an hologram by succeeding in a Logic check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         1 minute         | Innate |     ~seconds     |     Light Magic     |        0        |           Mana, 0           | Mediocre (Normal), Mediocre (Disadvantage), Mediocre (Super Disadvantage) |           None           |

The sound will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. You have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding a Logic check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         1 minute         | Innate |     ~seconds     |     Sound Magic     |        0        |           Mana, 0           | Mediocre (Normal), Mediocre (Disadvantage), Mediocre (Super Disadvantage) |           None           |

It must be within the effective range of the spell and it persists for the spell's duration. The illusion will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. When you opt for a sound, you have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration, or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. This illusory image lacks the ability to produce sound, light, scent, or any other sensory effects. When physically interacted with, the illusion is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound or image, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding in an Will check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll. If a creature successfully identifies the illusion, it becomes faint and transparent to that creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         1 minute         | Innate |     ~seconds     |      Mind Magic      |        0        |           Mana, 0           | Mediocre (Normal), Mediocre (Disadvantage), Mediocre (Super Disadvantage) |           None           |

Throughout the spell's duration, the object emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, accompanied by dim light for an additional 20 feet. You have the freedom to choose the color of the light. Should the object be fully covered with an opaque material, the emitted light is blocked. The spell concludes if cast anew or dismissed through an action. In the event that you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed in a Evasion Roll or Combat Roll to evade the effects of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          1 hour          | Innate |     ~seconds     |     Light Magic     |        0        |           Mana, 0           |                                   Melee                                   |           None           |

This apparition persists for the spell's duration or until you choose to dismiss it. The hand dissipates if it strays beyond a the spells effective range or if you cast the spell anew. You have the ability command the hand. Its functions include manipulating objects, opening unlocked doors or containers, stowing or retrieving items from open containers, and pouring the contents out of a vial. The hand's movement speed is equal to it's effective range. It is roughly as strong as the users hand. If attacks are made with it, treat it as the users own unarmed attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         1 minute         | Innate |     ~seconds     |    Gravity Magic    |        0        |           Mana, 0           | Mediocre (Normal), Mediocre (Disadvantage), Mediocre (Super Disadvantage) |           None           |

Note that this spell only heals living biological characters, it does not affect undead or constructs. At Higher Magic Resource, for each additional Magic Resource spent over base amount, healing tier increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       Instantaneous       | Innate |     ~seconds     |      Life Magic      |        1        |           Mana, 1           |                                   Melee                                   |           None           |

The target makes a Will Check versus the Magic Skill Roll of this spell. If successful, this spell inflicts an extra Minor Necrotic Injury whenever you inflict an injury. Additionally, you can select one of the target's core skills to impose a disadvantage on. If the target's is rendered unconscious or killed before the spell ends, you have the opportunity to bewitch another creature on a subsequent turn of yours. If a spell remove a curse from a target than this spell ends early.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   Concentration, 1 hour   | Innate |     ~seconds     |      Soul Magic      |        1        |           Mana, 1           |       Long (Normal), Long (Disadvantage), Long (Super Disadvantage)       |           None           |

While the intelligence of many beasts may limit their knowledge and awareness, they can, at a minimum, provide information about nearby locations and creatures, based on their perceptions from the past day. Depending on the Narrator's judgment, you might also be able to persuade a beast to carry out a small task for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |        10 minutes        | Innate |     ~seconds     |     Nature Magic     |        1        |           Mana, 1           |                                   Self                                   |           None           |

You can change your height by up to one foot and manipulate your apparent physique to appear thin, fat, or anything in between. However, you cannot alter your fundamental body structure, necessitating adherence to a form with a similar limb arrangement. Beyond this restriction, the extent of changes is within your control. Despite the alterations, if this spell is used to mimic another's appearance, depending on the skill level of the caster certain details might be off at close distances, especially for those that would know the mimicked character. To expose your disguise, a character can spend its action inspecting your appearance and must succeed in an Logic check versus the wins achieved when this spell is cast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |          1 hour          | Innate |     ~seconds     |     Bodily Magic     |        1        |           Mana, 1           |                                   Self                                   |           None           |

The target is aware there mind is being probed, and can either make a Deception check to deceive the mental invader, feeding them a false piece of information or Will check to force them out of their mind. The target has advantage if they are in combat with the caster or its allies. If the target is unable to resist, roll a d20, with the higher the roll being the more hidden the fact or secret. The target automatically resists the mental invasion if they are immune to being charmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       Instantaneous       | Innate |     ~seconds     |      Mind Magic      |        1        |           Mana, 1           | Mediocre (Normal), Mediocre (Disadvantage), Mediocre (Super Disadvantage) |           None           |

This illusion manifests within range and persists for the spell's duration. It remains purely visual, lacking any accompanying sound, smell, or other sensory aspects. Using your action, you can maneuver the illusion to any location within range. As it moves, you can adjust its appearance to mimic natural movements, such as walking for a creature. Physical interaction with the illusion reveals its true nature, as objects pass through it unhindered. A creature can use its action to scrutinize the illusion, potentially discerning its falseness with a successful Logic check against the Magic Skill Roll wins of this spell. Once the illusion is revealed, the creature can see through it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Concentration, 10 minutes | Innate |     ~seconds     |     Light Magic     |        1        |           Mana, 1           |        Far (Normal), Far (Disadvantage), Far (Super Disadvantage)        |           None           |

The target is required to make a Will versus the Magic Skill Rolls of this spell, gaining advantage if already engaged in combat with you or your allies. A failed check results in the creature being charmed (Charmed Condition) by you until the spell's conclusion or until you or your allies take hostile actions towards it. The charmed humanoid perceives you as a friendly acquaintance. Upon the conclusion of the spell, the creature becomes aware that it was under the influence of your charm.

The circle has an Area Of Effect of Sphere Calculation. When the oil appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on an Dexterity Check or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity Check or fall prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         1 minute         | Innate |     ~seconds     |     Earth Magic     |        1        |           Mana, 1           | Extended (Normal), Extended (Disadvantage), Extended (Super Disadvantage) | Medium Sphere Calculation |

The distance they can vertically jump also becomes the distance they can fall without incurring damage. Any distance beyond that counts as normal falling distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         1 minute         | Innate |     ~seconds     |      Air Magic      |        1        |           Mana, 1           |                                   Melee                                   |           None           |

A falling character's rate of descent slows to 10 feet per second. If the creature lands before the effect ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the effect for that creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         1 minute         | Innate |     ~seconds     |    Gravity Magic    |        1        |           Mana, 1           | Extended (Normal), Extended (Disadvantage), Extended (Super Disadvantage) |           None           |

Throughout the spell's duration, the ground in this zone transforms into difficult terrain. Any creature caught within the area upon casting must pass a Lift Check versus the spell's wins or restrained condition by the entwining plants until the spell concludes. A creature entangled can use its action to attempt a Lift check versus the spell's Wins. If successful, it breaks free. Once the spell dissipates, the summoned foliage withers and fades away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  Concentration, 1 minute  | Innate |     ~seconds     |     Nature Magic     |        1        |           Mana, 1           |        Far (Normal), Far (Disadvantage), Far (Super Disadvantage)        |           None           |

|         Read Thoughts         | During the spell's effect, you gain the ability to perceive the thoughts of specific creatures. When you cast the spell you can concentrate your mental focus on any visible creature within the spell's range. If the chosen creature possesses an -2 INT or lacks the ability to communicate through language, the spell has no effect. Initially, you access the surface thoughts of the creature, revealing its predominant concerns at that moment. You have the option to shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or delve deeper into the same creature's mind. When probing deeper, the targeted creature must succeed on a Will check versus the CL of the spell. Failure allows you to glean insights into its reasoning, emotional state, and significant preoccupations (such as worries, affections, or aversions). If successful, the spell terminates. Regardless of the outcome, the targeted creature becomes aware of your mental probing. Unless you shift your focus to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to initiate an Intelligence contest against your own; success terminates the spell. This spell proves particularly effective in interrogations, as questions directed at the target creature naturally influence its thought patterns. Additionally, you can employ this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures that are not visible to you. When casting the spell or as your action during its duration, you can scan for thoughts within the spells range. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead obstruct the ability. Creatures with an -2 INT or those lacking any language are undetectable. Upon detecting the presence of a creature using this method, you can read its thoughts for the remainder of the duration, following the same rules as described earlier, even if the creature is out of sight but still within range. |  Concentration, 1 minute  | Innate |     ~seconds     |      Mind Magic      |        2        |           Mana, 2           | Mediocre (Normal), Mediocre (Disadvantage), Mediocre (Super Disadvantage) |           None           |

When activated, causes flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. This sword gains the Fire damage type, and loses the Bleed damage type. The flames last until you  speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword. The blade can only be ignited as long as it is above 3 durability. The sword can be submerged in fire to repair the blade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |        Indefinite        | Innate |      1 hour      |      Fire Magic      |        5        |           Mana, 5           |                                   Melee                                   |           None           |

## Evasion Roll

When a Combat Roll is made against a character who is not capable of making an opposing Combat Roll, such as melee combatant being shot at from far away, the defender can make a reflexive Evasion Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll.

An Evasion Roll will use the Dice Pool of the Skill which represents reflexive dodging, which is generally "Dexterity". Evasion Roll's can be assisted, often by "Athletics", as faster top speeds can aid in being harder to hit.

Any levels over the defender's Evasion Roll wins count as Victory Levels for the attacker. The only victory level outcome a Evasion Roll can achieve is exiting a grapple.

## Combat Rounds

Combat is run in a Round-by-Round format. A Combat Round covers a brief period of time, which can be thought of roughly 10 seconds of in game time.

All the actions taken by charactes are considered to be happening simultaneously within the time narratively represented by the Combat Round.

To make sense of this potential chaos, first a Turn Order is determined which will last for the entire Combat. Then, for each Combat Round will be seperated into a Declaration Phase and an Action Phase.

### Turn Order

Turn Order is established based on which character has the highest RFX level. If multiple characters have the same RFX level, the character with the largest Dexterity Dice Pool has a higher Turn Order. If multiple characters have the same Dexterity Dice Pool size, than the character with the most Wins as a result of their Dexterity Dice Pool has a higher Turn Order.

### Declaration Phase

Starting from the bottom of Turn Order, characters declare what they are doing during the Combat Round.

Once a character has declared what actions they are performing during their Declaration Phase, they are locked into performing that action in this Combat Round.

Before higher Turn Order characters declare they are able to listen to the declarations of lower Turn Order characters. This allows higher Turn Order characters to declare actions that will either counter or complement the declared actions of lower Turn Order characters.

That might seem odd as you could think characters with higher Turn Order should get to act first, but this is the Declaration Phase, no actions have happened yet. Players who declare LATER hold the upper hand in combat. This means that characters with the highest Turn Order can react to what their opponents/allies are going to do.

#### Standard Combat Actions

Within a Combat Round a character can declare all of the following actions within a single round which don't require approval from the Narrator:

- Perform a Combat Roll
- Perform an Evasion Roll
- Use Movement Speeds to move around the battefield

#### Non-Standard Combat Actions

Additionally, a character can declare actions as part of a Combat Round not explicitley covered by the Standard Combat Actions. These actions often time require a Skill Check mid combat to determine if they succeeded. Whether these Non-Standard Combat Actions are able to be performed within the time confines of a Combat Round and in addition to the other actions the character might be declaring it up to the Narrator. Often, the Narrator can allow these action to be attempted but can give some penalty to the Combat Roll's Uses Per Round or to Movement Speed to reflect how valuable time is being lost.

Examples:

- Holding a door closed (Requires a contested Lift Check)
- Briefly shouting out an importaint piece of information (No addtional check or penalty)
- Quickly switching between weapons (Requires a Dexterity Check)
- Casting a spell that provides magic armor (Requires a Magic Skill check)

#### Action Phase

Once all characters have declared their actions, start with the actions of the highest Turn Order character. Then work down the Turn Order until everyone's declared action have be delt with.

Though actions are happpening simultaneously within a Combat Round, it's sometimes important to know which attack/actions happens before another, or who managed to perform their action a little bit faster than another. In these situations, characters with a higher Turn Order will always act first.

At the beginning of the Action Phase, all players can roll their Dice Pools for the actions they expect to take that round, such as Combat Rolls. This is to help things combat move efficiently.

Rolled Combat Rolls and Evasion Rolls made during a round are considered Standing Dice Pools for the entire Combat Round. This is to remember how many Wins a characters Combat Roll or Evasion Roll got incase they are using them against multiple sourceses. This is also incase a character loses dice due to injury or if they gain Disadvantage/Advantage during the Combat Round, which will affect an already rolled Dice Pool. If your character gains Disadvantage or Advantage after they've' already rolled their Combat Roll Dice Pool that Combat Round, you will retroactively apply said Disadvantage/Advantage to your those Dice Pools. This could turn some dice that were wins into fails and vice versa.

# Magic Rules

## Magic Systems

This page provides a generalized framework for magic system mechanics for any setting. Whether it be the Force from Star Wars, Bending from Avatar, Cyberpunk technomancy, or traditional fantasy magic, this framework should easily accommodate.

Fallen (the setting) has 4 premade magic systems as a reference and example:

- Druidcraft
- Fellcraft
- Runecraft
- Miracles

All magic systems built using this generalized framework require the following pieces of information to be determined.

### Magic Name

This is the name of the Magic in the setting. (Wizardry, Sorcery, Druidic magic, Pact Magic, etc...)

### Magic Vocation Name

This is the name of the Vocation for using that magic in the setting. (Wizard, Sorcerer, Druid, Warlock, etc...)

### Magic Vocation Governing Attributes

Different Magic Vocations rely on different attributes. Most traditional fantasy Magic Vocations have RFX and INT as their Magic Governing Attributes, as most magic benefits from quicker casting times and more knowledge. However, Magic Vocations that narratively rely on a character's physical body, such as genetic bloodline or biological magic, might also include STR as one of its Magic Vocation Governing Attributes.

### Magic Resource Name

Determining what fuels the Magic System is crucial. Is it the will of the caster, their connection with nature, or their connection to a divine entity? An example of a magic resource name is "Mana". See the Magic Resource rules for more information about the actual mechanics.

### Magic Governing Core Skill

A Magic Governing Core Skill is a Core Skill that is associated with a Magic Vocation. Used for instances when a character over-exerts themselves with their Magic Skill from their Magic Vocation, is trying to regain Magic Resource, or maintaining concentration on an already cast spell.

Examples of Magic Governing Core Skills:

* Magic that relies on the body to produce Magic Resource could use Endurance. (Bodily Magic)
* Magic that is equivalent to science or engineering, that relies only on the raw knowledge of the user could use Knowledge. (Wizard Magic)
* Magic that relies on bending the world around them through sheer will, such as through the mind, emotion, or spirit could use Will. (Sorcery Magic)
* Magic that relies upon a belief in a divine higher power could use Will. (Cleric Magic)
* Magic that relies upon a relationship with a divine being or a pact with a nefarious entity could use Persuasion, as it is only through the connection to the entity that the magic is held together. (Warlock Magic)
* Magic that relies upon one's ability to communicate with nature could use Persuasion. (Druidic Magic)

### Magic Skills

A Magic Vocation should contain a list of the Magic Skills that fall under its umbrella. See Magic Skills rules for more information on how to create a Magic Skill list.

### Cantrip Name (Optional)

For a bit of extra flare, determining a new name for Cantrips (or Novice Magic) can make a Magic Vocation feel more unique.

## Magic Resource

The required fuel, energy, or materials required to use magic are known as Magic Resource.

### Magic Resource Pool

Represents the pool of Magic Resource a character has to fuel their magic. Depending on a character's Magic Vocation and the Magic Governing Core Skill, your Magic Resource Pool will vary.

Magic Resource Pool = Vocation Magic Resource + Magic Governing Core Skill Magic Resource

#### Vocation Magic Resource

Vocation Magic Resource = Vocation Level * Vocation Dice Pool Size

- If a Vocation's level is 0, then use 0.5 for the Vocation Level variable in the calculation above and round down to the nearest whole number.

##### Vocation Magic Resource Examples

### Regaining Magic Resource

Detailed below are various ways a character could regain Magic Resource. The amount of Short Rests and Absorbing Magic Resource tasks performed can not exceed your Vocation Level, resetting on long rests.

#### Short Resting

Depending on your magic system, maintaining one's physical health can restore Magic Resource over time. A short rest takes roughly 1 hour and the character does nothing demanding. During this time they can tend to wounds, eat, drink, or relax. Characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Governing Core Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation). If negative or zero, none is regained.

#### Absorbing Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, Magic users can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements/magic/power to regain Magic Resource using a Magic skill. Characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Magic Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation). If negative or zero, none is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the elements/magic/power is acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

#### Long Resting

This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. A long rest of roughly 8 hours of downtime. During this downtime, at least 6 hours must be devoted to sleep. While being awake for no more than 2 hours of a long rest, characters can treat wounds, eat, drink, relax, and stand watch.

## Magic Skills

Magic Skills represent the ability to manipulate and control different magic elements, concepts, or whatever the Narrator desires.

The CL of any Magic Skill check is proportionate to the amount of Magic Resource required as fuel to attempt the roll, unless otherwise stated.

### Unlocking Magic Skills

Novice Tier Magic Skills (level 0) can be unlocked under an appropriate Magic Vocation for 1 skill point.

Incompetent Magic Skills (level -1) can be given by the Narrator as appropriate with the narrative. In general, a character with a level 0 Magic Vocation can have 1 Narrator given Incompetent magic skill, gaining 1 additional Incompetent magic skill per increase to the Magic Vocation Level.

Examples of unlocking Incompetent Magic Skills:

* A minute latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A natural element foreign to a character's place of origin. (Druid)

### Magic Skill Roll

Magic Skill Roll =

- 3d6 (Base Dice, varies with Spellcasting Focus Base Dice)
- +Xd6 (per Magic Skill)
- +Xd6 (per Magic Skill Governing Attributes)

### Generic Magic Skill List

Below is a non-exhaustive list of common magic skill, feel free to create your own. You can also try grouping different magic concepts under one magic skill for a magic system. For instance, in the popular video game Skyrim, the Destruction school of magic covered Fire, Ice, and Lightning.

#### Magic Skill Name

The name of the Magic Skill in question. The example Magic Skill Names below are extremely generic. If you are creating a new magic system, these magic skills could have different names.

#### Damage Types

Determines the Damage Types the Magic Skill is capable of inflicting.

#### Melee Capable

Determines if this Magic Skill could be used for melee combat. A good rule of thumb is if it can't create something physical that could block a blow, then it probably isn't Melee Capable.

#### Range Capable

Determines if the Magic Skill in question is capable of affecting something at range, which determines if a Magic Skill can make ranged attacks.

|            Magic Skill Name            |              Damage Types              | Melee Capable | Range Capable |

### Combo Magic Skills

Another avenue to explore is how magic skills could be combined.

- Plasma Magic = Heat Magic + Air Magic
- Storm Magic = Air Magic + Electricity Magic + Water Magic
- Magma Magic = Earth Magic + Heat Magic
- Blizzard Magic = Cold Magic + Air Magic
- Frost Magic = Water Magic + Cold Magic

### Spellcasting Focus

All magic needs a Spellcasting Focus to be cast through wether a wizard's staff, a druid's focus, or even a character's own body. Just about anything can be made into a Spellcasting Focus from a narrative perspective, but it is up to the Narrator to decide if their are any restrictions in their magic system/setting.

Spellcasting Focuses often have Skill Base Dice Effects on them that influence the magic skills cast through it, assuming they apply to that skill.

## Spells

Spells are ways a character can use their Magic Skills.

Players can create Spells on the fly with the Narrator's approval. For instance, there is no need to have a predefined Spell for lighting a campfire with Fire Magic or clearing a collapsed tunnel with Earth Magic. The player can just describe what they are about to attempt with their magic and the Narrator will set the CL of the Spell just like any other skill check.

If the created Spell is worth remembering for later use or to share, it can be written down as a Spell such as in the Spell Tables below. It is worth remembering that the Spells on the table below are simply a snapshot of how someone used a Magic Skill for a Spell that they thought was reasonable. If a Narrator wanted to run a game with only pre-defined Spells (such as how D&D does) then they absolutely can.

To use a Spell a character must:

- Have a Magic Skill capable of performing the Spell.
- Achieve the CL required to cast the Spell with their Magic Skill Roll.
- Have enough Magic Resource to consume, which will always be equal to the Spell's CL.

The Magic Resource needed to cast the Spell is always consumed even if the Magic Skill Roll check is unsuccessful.

Certain Spells can consume additional Magic Resource to increase the Spell's effect. A Spell can only consume as much Magic Resource as the wins from the Magic Skill Roll.

### The Need For Reasonable Constraints On Magic

Stories are at there very core about some conflict. Everyone loves well thought our magic systems because they add interesting ways to resolve conflicts within a story. Whether it be the Force from Star Wars, Bending from Avatar, or Wizardry from the Dresden Files, "magic" in each setting gives the heroes and villains new ways to interact with the conflict of the story.

If a Magic System completely trivializes the conflict of the story, than the story won't grip the audience in the same way. Hence, the defining characteristic of really good Magic Systems are believable constraints that allow you to suspend your disbelief. Reasonable constraints, in a strange but true way, are what allow creativity, as without any constraints characters could just instantly resolve the conflict of the story with their magic.

For example, when Luke Skywalker famously picks up the X-wing from the swamp, it makes sense to our brains that it is difficult and straining to move something so large. It took disciple, training, and overcoming his own inner demons to eventually become powerful in the Force. Had Luke had insane Force power from the very beginning with no explanation and instantly defeated the entire Empire with them, I'd argue you'd have a horrible story.

Hence, the whole point of the Fogent Roleplay Magic rules is to help define reasonable constraints on any magic systems. This means the magic systems is constrained enough to not completely break the narrative, but open for creative solutions with magic.

### How To Elegantly Run Magic Systems

The trick with the Fogent Magic system is we already have the most important tools for covering most magic systems, skills and CLs. Whenever a player asks to use their Lift Skill to pick up a rock, the Narrator and players already have a rough idea of how hard that check should be. We can use the same intuitive understanding most of us have likely picked up from watch movies, reading books, or playing games to elegantly determine how difficult doing something with magic should be.

It is extremely intuitive that a character with Fire magic could Trivially (CL 0) light a campfire, assuming they have the required wood. In the same vein, it would be common (CL 1) for a character with Fire Magic to shoot a fire bolt at something reasonably close. The point being is that we don't technically need super defined rules for how every Magic Skill exactly works. We as consumers of stories and narratives already reasonably understand what these things should be able to do.

The caveat is that having super defined spells are very nice to have as they allow people to share cool ways they though of to use their magic skills. Therefore, all the defined Spell are just one way someone reasonably thought they could use a Magic Skill. This give the Narrator and players the ability to get a rough idea of what a magic skill is capable of at that CL. And if you did want a super "rules-as-written"constrained magic systems, than you can totally just define the exact ways that magic can be used for a magic system or setting. You get to have your cake and eat it too!

### Reasonable Ranges of Spells

Below are guide lines for the Ranges that Magic Skill can be used at for general narrative purposes, usually similar to the Avatar: The Last Air Bender techniques.

A character may attempt to use their magic within the following Ranges depending on how much Magic Resource that is consumed. If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

| Magic Resource Consumed |      Range      |
| :---------------------: | :-------------: |
|            0            | Medium or Melee |
|            1            |  Far or Reach  |
|            2            |      Long      |
|            3            |     Distant     |
|            4            |  Sharpshooter  |

### Spell Concentration

Certain Spells demand a character's concentration to keep their effects active. If this concentration is interrupted, the Spell ends.

If a Spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a Magic Governing Core Skill check to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming Physically Incapacitated or dying. If you're Physically Incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena might require the concentrating character to succeed on a Governing Core Skill check to maintain concentration. For example, a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship might require a CL 2 Governing Core Skill Check.

### Using Spells In Combat

If a character intends to use Spells during a combat round, on the Declaration Phase they will declare what Spell they are attempting to use with the following rules in mind.

- A character can cast 1 spell per round that uses Magic Resource.
- A character can cast 1 spell per round that does not use Magic Resource.
- A character can only cast 1 spell per turn as their combat roll.

On the Action Phase, the character makes a Magic Skill roll to see if they were able to achieve the Spell they declared. If they succeed, the Spell is cast. If the Spell was a Weapon Spell, than the additional dice from the Weapon Spell are rolled and are combined with the already rolled Magic Skill dice, making up the Magic Combat Roll. If they were unsuccessful in casting the spell, the Spell is not cast but the magic resource is still consumed.

### Weapon Spells

**Casting Time:** Instantaneous

**Duration:** 1 round

From the Magic Skill used to cast this Spell, create flavored magic armaments for use in combat. As part of the same Weapon Spell, an armament can be created in each hand to benefit from the Dual Wielded Modifier or shield. The Defense the shield provides is dependant on the Magic Skill used. For instance, while Earth magic could create a Physical Defense Shield, it could not create a Mental Defense Shield.

Damage Types are determined by the Magic Skill used.

If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

Weapon Spell Combat Roll = (Magic Skill roll) + (Weapon Spell Dice Modifiers)

Almost all traditional offensive magic spells can be represented as Weapon Spells.

- Bone Claws = Bodily Magic Skill + One-handed Slash Close Melee, Dual-wielded Slash Close Melee
- Fire Bolt = Fire Magic Skill + Light Crossbow
- Cone of Cold = Cold Magic + Magic Medium Cone
- Water Whip = Water Magic Skill + Whip
- Earth Shield = Earth Magic + Large Shield

## Character Creation Rules

- [Character Sheet Template](./src/CoreRules/CharacterCreationRules/temp/temp/temp/CharacterSheetTemplate.md)

## Disabling Characteristics

Disabling characteristics represent flaws your character has. This is an essential part of every great character as everyone needs a shortcoming to overcome or a temptation to fall into. It should be noted that disabling characteristics can be remedied through narrative with the Narrator's approval. If Disabling Characteristics are gained mid-campaign, it should make intuitive sense for that character. Maybe they picked up an addiction, got their heart broken, have a new fear of a monster they've recently faced or are suffering the long-lasting impact of a serious injury they took. Regardless this should be a negotiation between the player and Narrator.

| Name | Description | Duration | Source |

## Tier Of Play

### Stuff to move down

Two kinds of skills fall under a Vocation, Vocational Skills and Combat Skills.

## Weapon Combat Skills

A Weapon Combat Skill covers the use of a group of similar weapons. The tables over on the Weapons rules show which weapons are group under which Weapon Combat Skills. For instance, the "Medium Melee" Weapon Combat Skill covers the use of "Medium Hafted", "Medium Sword", and "Medium Spear".

All Weapon Combat Skills have the governing attributes of STR, RFX, and INT. This is to reflect that the stronger, faster, and smarter a character is, the more lethal they are in combat regardless of the weapon. A STR character hits harder, is tougher, and is more conditioned for combat. A RFX character hits faster and is harder to pin down. An INT character hits smarter and uses tactics. It is the player's/Narrator's job to flavor their attacks to reflect how they are leveraging their innate attributes as they fight.

### Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

There is obviously overlap certain Weapon Combat Skills. For melee Weapon Combat Skills, weapon reach, footwork, and the biomechanics of swinging a weapon have some overlap. For ranged Weapon Combat Skills, having a proper base, judging the distance, leading your targets, aiming and releasing the projectile smoothly are examples of the overlap. Narrators should allow a character to gain Weapon Combat Skills, though of a lesser level, in similar Weapon Combat Skills in regards to size and function. This not only allows characters to experiment with new weapons but also makes narrative sense.

Starting with the weapon skill your character currently possesses, each horizontal (right and left on the table) or vertical (up and down on the table) jump is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. When moving horizontally within a Size type, you may loop around the other side of the table as if it were right beside it. You cannot go below 0 on a combat skill for either melee or ranged weapons via the table below.

#### Melee Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

|   Weapons   |
| :----------: |
| Close Melee |
| Medium Melee |
| Large Melee |
| Reach Melee |

#### Bow/Crossbow Weapon Skill Transfer

| Size/Type |   Bows   |   Crossbows   |
| :-------: | :-------: | :------------: |
|   Hand   |          | Hand Crossbow |
|   Light   | Light Bow | Light Crossbow |
|   Heavy   | Heavy Bow | Heavy Crossbow |

#### Guns

|   Weapons   |
| :---------: |
| Small Guns |
| Medium Guns |
| Heavy Guns |

#### Respecing Combat Skills

Since certain weapon sizes provide more combat skill transfer than others, it is intend for the Narrator to allow rebalancing skill point investments as to not waste skill levels as long as all previously know skills maintain they're skill level.

For example, a character has just been given 1 skill point to spend and has a level 3 in Small Blade. They wish to invest their skill point into the Medium Sword skill to try a new magic sword they found. Since they have a 3 in Small Blade already, by the Weapon Combat Skill Transfer rules they have a level 2 in Medium Sword. If they were to invest their skill point into Medium Sword to bring it to level 3, they are technically wasting skill points as had they from the start only invested the 3 skill points from Small Blade into Medium sword, with the addition of the unspent skill point, they'd have a level 4 in Medium sword, which would also give them a level 3 in Small Blade. Instead of wasting skill points, they can take the 3 skill points from Small Blade and the 1 unspent skill point and spend it on bring Medium sword to level 4. Since having a level 4 in Medium Sword gives a level 3 in Small Blade, nothing has changed in Small Blade.

#### Combat Skills

Combat Skills are skills that are used for fighting, including all Weapon Combat Skills and Combat Magic Skills. These skills require skill points to be increased.

#### Vocational Skills

Vocational Skills are skills that your Vocation would logically give you. A Vocational Skill's level is inherited from Vocation's level. Players can make Vocational Skills at any point with approval from the Narrator and use them for applicable skill checks.

Vocational Skills will often overlap with one or more Core Skills, though they will represent a much more specialized subset of tasks. Often times a Vocational Skill will combine what would usually be multiple sequential harder Core Skill checks into a single often easier Vocational Skill check.

Vocational Skills can never cover a majority of what a Core Skill covers. You can not assist Vocational Skills with the Vocation they fall under, as they are essentially relying on the same shared skill point investment.

It is smart to write down Vocational Skills under your vocation as a reminder to have on your character sheet.

Tier Of Play narratively describes the stakes of the campaign as well as how powerful/competent player characters are. This balances the players against each other and the challenges the Narrator has envisioned.

The Narrator should let the players know the Tier Of Play and players should factor this into their characters. It would be silly to have a character's backstory paint them as a badass only to have them start at Apprentice Tier. Also, realize that your character will grow throughout their story and the Narrator will be rewarding players with ways to improve your character as they play.

Whenever building a character starting at a higher level than 1, you must build that character as if they were starting from level 1.

### Tier of Play Breakdown

#### Skill/Vocation Level Cap

This is the maximum you can take any skill or vocation level to in the Tier Of Play.

#### Vocation Point

Points that can only be spent to unlock or upgrade Vocations.

#### Attribute Points

The number of points you can spend to increase a character's Attributes.

#### Skill Points

The number of points you get to spend on Core Skills, Vocations, and Combat Skills.

#### Disabling Characteristics

See Disabling Characteristics rules.

At character creation, for each Disabling Characteristic that makes a Core Skill Incompetent (level -1), an additional skill point is gained.

At character creation, players characters that take a Disabling Characteristic that results in a -1 in an Attribute (STR, RFX, or INT would be Feeble, Heavy, Dim-witted, etc...) gain an additional 2 skill points.

#### Tiers of Play

#### Apprentice Tier (D&D Level 1 - 4)

## Character Creation

This document introduces a step by step walk through of how to build a character.

### Step 0: Javk Wick's character creation house rules (Optional)

Howdy all, this is Javk Wick. Here are some house rules for character creation that I implement almost all of my campaigns, especially with brand new players. They've served me very well and I'd highly encourage you to use them to avoid common pitfalls.

#### Player Characters can't start evil

Unless the Narrator is running an evil campaign, player characters can't start as evil.

Reason being, the majority of players won't be evil characters. Early on, as at this point there is minimal connection between a party of characters, the majority good portion of the party will either boot out or kill the evil character for one of their evil deeds. With new players this will undoubtedly cause some real world friction and the now narratively dead player will have to make a whole new character mid campaign.

However, notice how I said "Player Characters can't start evil" and not "No evil Player Characters". The reality is, that it is awesome for the narrative when player characters have a tight knit group, and one of the characters turns to the dark side for in their mind compelling reasons. Since all the player characters have history with one another, they are more likely to not boot or kill the now evil character, and instead try to bring them back to the light. This inevitably becomes the heart of the story, and is extremely gripping. Anakin Skywalker is the best example of this effect in narrative, as we are able to watch his downfall.

#### No joke Player Characters

Unless the Narrator is running a goofy/silly campaign, no joke player characters.

You can easily spot a joke character when they are completely clashing with the themes and world setting that the Narrator has chosen for the campaign. For example, it would be completely out of place to have a character that is essentially Spongebob in a gritty dark fantasy setting. These characters end up ruining the immersion of other players and make it difficult for the Narrator to get across the world he/she has envisioned.

#### No loner Player Characters

No loner/antisocial characters that constantly split the group and never interact with the other player characters.

The player characters are the main characters and main characters interact with one another. They should also probably like the other characters or at least have a reason why they have to work together. Table top roleplay games are at their core about spending quality time with your friends. If a player wants to have the loner experience, they can go play Skyrim or something.

### Step 1: Start with an archetype

For people who have never made a character before, it can be quite daunting to know where to start. Fear not, as you likely already have all the knowledge you need from the movies, shows, books, and other media you have watched through your life.

Picking an archetype is a great starting place to think about a character. It doesn't mean that your character has to stick purely to the archetype. It is more of a jumping off point.

These archetypes can of course depends on the setting you are playing in, though you'd be surprised how much a wizards in a fantasy setting is narratively similar to a mad scientist in a cyber punk setting. What follows is a non-exhaustive list of some common archetypes found in fantasy.

#### Strength Archetypes

- The Fighter
- The Warrior
- The Knight
- The Barbarian

#### Reflex Archetypes

- The Rogue
- The Thief
- The Assassin
- The Martial Artist

#### Intelligence Archetypes

- The Wizard (Abilities gained through intense study)
- The Bard (Abilities gained through learning to socially influence people)
- The Charlatan
- The Detective

#### Other Magical Archetypes

- The Warlock (Abilities gained through a pact with a powerful entity)
- The Sorcerer (Abilities gained through their bloodline)
- The Druid (Abilities gained through their connection to nature)

#### Additional Archetypes

- The Criminal
- The Orphan
- The Local Hero

### Step 2: Understand what Tier Of Play you're playing

A Tier Of Play narratively describe the stakes of the campaign. Your Narrator should let you know your tier of play and you should factor this into your character as it would be silly to have your character's backstory to paint them as a master wizard only to have them start in the Apprentice Tier Of Play. Also realize that your character will grow throughout the course of their story and your Narrator will be rewarding you will skill points as you play.

### Step 3: Write a rough Backstory

Given the archetype you chose, the tier of play, and world setting the Narrator has chosen, write a rough backstory about your character. You'll come back later at the end to polish it, but just get across the broad strokes at this stage.

Here are some important questions to ask about your character:

- What is your name?
- Where are you from?
- What is their sex?
- What is their age?
- What is their race?
- Does your race have innate abilities like magic?
- What strengths do you have?
- What flaws do you have?
- What is their appearance (hair color, eye color, skin color, height, weight, body type)? Finding some character art or generating some ai art is very useful for this step.
- What is their disposition (i.e. how do they act most of the time)?
- What are their beliefs/morality?
- What are their goals/aspirations?
- Do they have friends/family?
- Do they have romantic interests/exes.

### Step 4: Pick your Vocation, spend your Vocation Point

Regardless of the Tier Of Play, you'll have a vocation point to spend. This is a point you get to spend to unlock your first Vocation, whatever your character's life path/job has been. Luckily, if you already picked an archetype that you are going for, you've probably already have your Vocation. For instance, if I wanted to play a Rogue archetype, than my vocation could just be Rogue.

### Step 5: Choose Disabling Characteristics

Disabling Characteristics represent flaws your character has. This is an essential part of every character as everyone needs a short coming to overcome or temptation to fall to. It should be noted that Disabling Characteristics can be remedied through narrative with the Narrators approval.

### Step 6: Spend your Attribute Points

Attributes represent the innate characteristics of your character. They have one of the largest impacts on your character so you should choose wisely. Most often you'd choose attributes that make sense given your Vocation ( Strength for Barbarian, Reflex for Rogue, Intelligence for Wizard, etc...).

### Step 7: Spend your Skill Points

Each Skill Point can be used to increase one core skill, vocation, or combat skill level by 1. It should be noted that no skill can increased above the "Skill/Vocation Level Cap" as defined by your Tier Of Play.

### Step 8: Determine your starting equipment

If the setting has an built economy such as Fallen, based on your characters backstory the Narrator will assign your socioeconomic status. Then you choose whether to roll for your wealth or take the average.

If the setting doesn't have a built economy, then the players and Narrator can work together to figure out what equipment your character might have based on their backstory and Tier Of Play.

# Hardcore Rules

## Item Durability (Optional)

This is an optional rule for setting where the durability of ones equipment has narrative significance. Using item durability is a great way to increase immersion (such as having to go to a blacksmith or learn to repair their gear) and challenge your players. However, for players who want a more casual experience, item durability can be disregarded.

With these rules, all weapons, armor, and spellcasting focuses now have durability. Whatever the Base Dice associated with that item determines how much durability it has. When an item's durability falls, each time your item's durability falls to the lower tier's max durability, that lower tier's base dice are used instead. For instance, if a character had a "Legendary" Base Dice sword with only 23 durability remaining they would be rolling the "Superior" Base Dice or "1d10, 2d8".

### Weapon Durability

A weapon's Durability decreases by 1 whenever a weapon is used to attempt to inflict an injury level.

### Spellcasting Focus Durability

A Spellcasting Focus's durability decreases by 1 whenever a Spell is cast with it.

### Armor Durability

If an injury is fully negated by armor, then the defender can decide which pieces of armor take armor damage. The armor must sum up to the defense level required to prevent the incoming injury and all take the same amount of armor damage. An armor's durability decreases by the level of injury inflicted plus the attack's defense penetration.

- Armor damage = (level of injury inflicted) + (combat roll penetration)

If an injury is not fully negated by the defender's armor, then all pieces of armor take armor damage.

|    Name    | Level | Base Dice | Durability Max |
| :---------: | :---: | :--------: | :------------: |
|   Broken   |  -4  |    0d6    |       0       |
| Compromised |  -3  |    3d4    |       3       |
|   Damaged   |  -2  |  1d6, 2d4  |       6       |
|   Shoddy   |  -1  |  2d6, 1d4  |       9       |
|   Mundane   |   0   |    3d6    |       12       |
|   Quality   |   1   |  1d8, 2d6  |       15       |
|    Fine    |   2   |  2d8, 1d6  |       18       |
|  Excellent  |   3   |    3d8    |       21       |
|  Superior  |   4   | 1d10, 2d8 |       24       |
|  Exquisite  |   5   | 2d10, 1d8 |       27       |
|  Flawless  |   6   |    3d10    |       30       |
| Mastercraft |   7   | 1d12, 2d10 |       33       |
|   Fabled   |   8   | 2d12, 1d10 |       36       |
|    Epic    |   9   |    3d12    |       39       |
|  Legendary  |  10  | 1d20, 2d12 |       42       |
|   Mythic   |  11  | 2d20, 1d12 |       45       |
|  Artifact  |  12  |    3d20    |       48       |

# Variant Rule

These are optional rules that aren't required and are up to the Narrator if they will be used.

### Rounding Range to work on battle map

*When using a Range on a battlemap, if any of the components of the Range have a decimal remainder, round down to the nearest multiple of 5 ft.

### 5 Summed injury dice causes Incapacitated

A character is rendered Physically Incapacitated once they've taken a summed 5 or above injury dice.

### Skill Specialty

Once a skill's Dice Pool is equal to or greater than 8 dice you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill, when asked to make a check utilizing that skill with a Challenge Level of 3 or less, you automatically pass if all of the following are true.

- You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influences or aggression such as combat.)
- The check is not contested.
- The check is not a reflexive action.

### Turn Order not based on Dexterity

If multiple characters have the same RFX level, they each roll a D20, where the highest resulting roll gets being higher in turn order declare later for the rest of the combat encounter.
