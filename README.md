## Welcome to Fogent Roleplay

Welcome to Fogent Roleplay.

Fogent Roleplay is a setting agnostic TTRPG (Table Top Roleplay Game) that is intended to remove the unneeded complexity common in many TTRPGs while not sacrificing emergent/tactical gameplay. If you love the simplicity, flexibility, and narrative focus of Cogent Roleplay, but love tactical battle map combat, magic items, campaign progression, and sweet loot, then you are in the right place.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then D&D:

- **Setting Agnostic:** Unlike most TTRPGs, Fogent Roleplay and it's rules aren't tied any setting. It is designed from the ground up to easily run games in existing settings or in brand-new ones you create. This way, your group can learn one easy-to-use system to play in various settings such as medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, galactic warfare, survival horror, etc... This makes Fogent Roleplay great for world builders and authors looking to collaboratively create/reveal their worlds.
- **Elegant and Intuitive Rules:** While other TTRPGs require multiple books worth of rules to play, by contrast, Fogent Roleplay has ~40 pages of core rules, much of which consist of examples. This makes Fogent Roleplay extremely easy for new Players/Narrators to pick up.
- **Narrative Focused:** Most TTRPGs feel very different in and out of combat, with non-combat roleplay having great narrative flow where your character can attempt almost anything, but once combat is entered it feels more like a video game where characters can only perform the exact actions as described in the rules. Fogent Roleplay elegantly handles combat within the narrative flow while still having balanced/tactical combat. Combat in Fogent Roleplay feels more like an awesome fight scene in a movie, rather than video game characters just trying to get each other to 0 HP.
- **Offloading Complexity to the Narrative:** The rules are purposefully built to offload as much complexity to the narrative as possible. Instead of every rule complexity/edge case turing into a legal battle between the players and narrator, it just becomes a discussion about what would narratively make sense. Therefore, what is best for your character mechanically, what logically makes sense in the context of the setting, and what is most narratively satisfying are the same thing in Fogent Roleplay!
- **Making the Narrator's Job Easy:** Fogent Roleplay is neither designed to nor intends to have a rule for every minute situation. Instead, we want to give the Narrator a multi-tool of powerful, flexible, and intuitive rules. We want a Narrator's pre-game prep to primarily consist of creating insane plot twists, designing cool combat encounters, crafting awesome magic items, figuring out how a player character's backstory ties into the story, ect... rather than spending hours understanding rules.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then Cogent Roleplay:

* **Innovation:** Whether it be rebalanced Core Skills, reworked Vocations, rebalanced weapons, an Advantage/Disadvantage system, rebalanced destiny point rules, automated character sheet support, etc... Fogent Roleplay has taken the best ideas of Cogent Roleplay to their logical conclusions while embracing innovation.
* **Tactical Battlemap Combat:** Fogent Roleplay has rules to be run on a battlemap. This allows for awesome tactical fight scenes where a character's positioning and surrounding environment factor into combat. While Fogent Roleplay can be run in the theater of the mind, it works even better on a battlemap.
* **Mature Ruleset:** Fogent Roleplay provides a mature and robust ruleset with no mechanical edge cases (if you can find one, please let us know). Not only were the rules battle-tested via 100+ sessions durning it's development, most of the rules have been converted into code equivalent logic. Since the resulting software works, the rules are mechanically robust.
* **Dice Pool Scaling:** Fogent Roleplay wants players to feel like ever small improvement has a tangible impact. To this end, whenever possible we scale off the size of dice pools of the various skills a character has for just about everything. If your character has a big Athletics dice pool, they are really fast both in and out of combat. Did you just improve your magic skill, we'll now all your lower level spells just got slightly increased range, area of effect, uses per round, ect...
* **Magic System Rules:** The Magic System Template allows for the easy creation of balanced magic systems regardless of the setting.
* **Pre-made Settings:** If you don't have the time to come up with an entire setting for your players to play in, Fogent Roleplay comes with pre-made campaign settings. This is an ongoing effort with more becoming available over time.
