# Introduction

## Welcome to Fogent Roleplay

Welcome to Fogent Roleplay.

Fogent Roleplay is a setting agnostic TTRPG (Table Top Roleplay Game) that is intended to remove the unneeded complexity common in many TTRPGs while not sacrificing emergent/tactical gameplay. If you love the simplicity, flexibility, and narrative focus of Cogent Roleplay, but love tactical battle map combat, magic items, campaign progression, and sweet loot, then you are in the right place.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then D&D:

- **Setting Agnostic:** Unlike most TTRPGs, Fogent Roleplay and it's rules aren't tied any setting. It is designed from the ground up to easily run games in existing settings or in brand-new ones you create. This way, your group can learn one easy-to-use system to play in various settings such as medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, galactic warfare, survival horror, etc... This makes Fogent Roleplay great for world builders and authors looking to collaboratively create/reveal their worlds.
- **Elegant and Intuitive Rules:** While other TTRPGs require multiple books worth of rules to play, by contrast, Fogent Roleplay has ~40 pages of core rules, much of which consist of examples. This makes Fogent Roleplay extremely easy for new Players/Narrators to pick up.
- **Narrative Focused:** Most TTRPGs feel very different in and out of combat, with non-combat roleplay having great narrative flow where your character can attempt almost anything, but once combat is entered it feels more like a video game where characters can only perform the exact actions as described in the rules. Fogent Roleplay elegantly handles combat within the narrative flow while still having balanced/tactical combat. Combat in Fogent Roleplay feels more like an awesome fight scene in a movie, rather than video game characters just trying to get each other to 0 HP.
- **Off Loading Complexity to the Narrative:** The rules are purposefully built to off load as much complexity to the narrative as possible. Instead of every rule complexity/edge case turing into a legal battle between the players and narrator, it just becomes a discussion about what would narratively make sense. Therefore, what is best for your character in terms of the context of the rules, what logically makes sense in the world, and what is most narratively satisfying are the same thing in Fogent Roleplay!
- **Making the Narrator's Easy:** Fogent Roleplay is neither designed to nor intends to have a rule for every minute situation. Instead, we want to give the Narrator a multi-tool of powerful, flexible, and intuitive rules. We want a Narrator's pre-game prep to primarily consist of creating insane plot twists, designing cool combat encounters, crafting awesome magic items, figuring out how the a player character's backstory ties into the story, ect... rather than spending hours understanding rules.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then Cogent Roleplay:

* **Innovation:** Whether it be rebalanced Core Skills, reworked Vocations, rebalanced weapons, an Advantage/Disadvantage system, rebalanced destiny point rules, automated character sheet support, etc... Fogent Roleplay has taken the best ideas of Cogent Roleplay to their logical conclusions while embracing innovation.
* **Tactical Battlemap Combat:** Fogent Roleplay has rules to be run on a battlemap. This allows for awesome tactical fight scenes where a character's positioning and surrounding environment factor into combat. While Fogent Roleplay can be run in the theater of the mind, it works even better on a battlemap.
* **Mature Ruleset:** Fogent Roleplay provides a mature and robust ruleset with no mechanical edge cases (if you can find one, please let us know). Not only were the rules battle-tested via 100+ sessions durning it's development, most of the rules have been converted into code equivalent logic. Since the resulting software works, the rules are mechanically robust.
* **Magic System Template:** The Magic System Template allows for the easy creation of balanced magic systems regardless of the setting.
* **Pre-made Settings:** If you don't have the time to come up with an entire setting for your players to play in, Fogent Roleplay comes with pre-made campaign settings. This is an ongoing effort with more becoming available over time.

May your stories be epic,

-Javk "The Forever Narrator" Wick

# General Rules

## Dice Pools

A Dice Pool is a collection of one or more dice that when rolled determines how many "Wins" where achieved for whatever task was being attempted. D6 dice (otherwise known as six-sided dice) are the most common dice used, though D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are also used.

After the Dice Pool has been rolled, you sum up the amount of "Wins" from the roll. Any rolled dice that gets a 4 or greater counts as a win. D6 dice have a 50% chance of rolling a win, as 4, 5, and 6 on the dice are wins. D4s only have a 25% chance of a win, since only the 4 on the dice counts as a win. In general, the more dice and the more faces the dice have, the better the chances are of getting more wins.

| Dice Type | Probability of Win |
| :-------: | :----------------: |
|    D4    |        25%        |
|    D6    |        50%        |
|    D8    |       62.5%       |
|    D10    |        70%        |
|    D12    |        75%        |
|    D20    |        85%        |

All Dice Pools start with their "Base Dice", which by default are 3d6. You then add a D6 for each skill point, attribute point, or additional modifier that governs the Dice Pool.

Whenever you are removing dice from a dice pool (often done after taking an injury), always remove the lowest-sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.

## Challenge Level

Challenge Level represents the difficulty of a task set by the narrator proportionate to an **AVERAGE PERSON OF THE WORLD**. If a character is able to get enough wins to meet or beat the challenge level, they succeeded.

|      Difficulty      | Challenge Level |
| :------------------: | :-------------: |
|       Trivial       |      CL 0      |
|        Common        |      CL 1      |
|       Uncommon       |      CL 2      |
|     Specialized     |      CL 3      |
|      Difficult      |      CL 4      |
| Extremely Difficult |      CL 5      |
|     Unrealistic     |      CL 6      |
| Virtually Impossible |      CL 7      |
|    Inconceivable    |      CL 8      |
|      Legendary      |      CL 9      |

Pay attention the names of each Challenge Level. They are intended help Narrators and Players both intuitively understand how hard something should be within the narrative of the story.

For example, Javk Wick the Rogue hoist his unconscious injured ally onto his shoulders to get them both to safety. The Narrator determines that picking up someones limp body and getting them to your shoulders is neither a "Trivial" or "Common" thing for the average person to do. The Narrator sets the Challenge Level at "Uncommon" (CL 2) using the Lift Skill. If the ally was instead conscious, the Narrator might only set the Challenge Level to "Common" (CL 1) as hoisting an unconscious limp is far harder than a conscious compliant one.

## Attributes

Attributes represent the innate characteristics of a character. An attribute can go from level -2 to level 5. Each level corresponds with a narrative significance.

| Attribute Level |                      Narrative Meaning                      |
| :-------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |            Painfully lacking in the attribute.            |
|       -1       |            Below an average person in our world.            |
|        0        |               An average person in our world.               |
|        1        |              Professional or naturally gifted.              |
|        2        | Elite or 'world-class'. Peak of real world human potential. |
|        3        |                Meta-human or genetic anomaly                |
|        4        |                        Demigod like                        |
|        5        |                Peak achievable or god like.                |

### Strength (STR)

Represents a character's innate muscle strength, bone density, tendon strength, physical durability, etc...

| Attribute Level |            Narrative Meaning            |
| :-------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                A squirrel                |
|       -1       |   Below an average person in our world   |
|        0        |      An average person in our world      |
|        1        |      Professional soldier or knight      |
|        2        | World's strongest man champion or Batman |
|        3        |     Bear, Ogre, or Captain America     |
|        4        |                 Hercules                 |
|        5        |                 Superman                 |

STR has the following effects:

- STR is factored into all STR Governed Skills (Athletics, Endurance, Lift, etc...). Greater STR can help a character move more in a combat round and carry heavier gear without being penalized.
- STR is a character's physical and bodily durability. In combat, for every point in STR a character can reduce a victory level achieved against them from physical (bludgeon, slash, pierce, etc...) or bodily (poisons, cold, etc...) damage types once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every point in STR a character can reduce a physical or bodily damage type injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of respite between each injury.

### Reflex (RFX)

Represents a character's innate reflexes, reaction speed, nervous system, fine motor control, nimbleness, agility, quickness...

| Attribute Level |                 Narrative Meaning                 |
| :-------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                  A sea cucumber                  |
|       -1       |       Below an average person in our world       |
|        0        |          An average person in our world          |
|        1        | Professional thief, parkourist, or circus acrobat |
|        2        |    Gold medal gymnast or master martial artist    |
|        3        |                      Legolas                      |
|        4        |                     Spiderman                     |
|        5        |                The Flash or Hermes                |

RFX has the following effects:

- RFX is factored into all RFX Governed Skills (Dexterity, Perception, Stealth, etc...).
- As combat is conducted in a round-by-round format, the player with the highest RFX gets priority in that round.
- RFX allows characters to move before slower characters and increases all Combat Speeds.

### Intelligence (INT)

Represents a character's innate raw mental horsepower, IQ, consciousness, and mental/spiritual durability.

| Attribute Level |                           Narrative Meaning                           | Skill Points Gained/Lost Total |
| :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|       -2       |                               A zombie                               |               -3               |
|       -1       |                 Below an average person in our world                 |               -1               |
|        0        |                    An average person in our world                    |               0               |
|        1        |           University science professor or career politician           |               1               |
|        2        | Award-winning particle physicist or 'Sherlock Holmes' level detective |               3               |
|        3        |                              Tony Stark                              |               6               |
|        4        |                           Ultron or Skynet                           |               10               |
|        5        |                       Dr. Manhattan or Athena                       |               15               |

INT has the following effects:

- INT is factored into all INT Governed Skills (General Knowledge, Willpower, Communication, etc...).
- Starting at 0, for every INT point a player receives, they gain the same amount of additional skill points to spend. This effect is cumulative, refer to the "Skill Points Gained/Lost" to the total amount of skill points for a given INT level.
- INT is a measure of how durable a character's consciousness is to mental and spiritual attacks. In combat, for every point in INT a character can reduce a victory level achieved against them from spiritual or psychic damage types once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every point in INT a character can reduce a spiritual or psychic damage type injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of respite between each injury.

### Why is there no Charisma Attribute

INT governs the "Communications" skill which is essentially your classical charisma stat. The reality is that being smarter makes you a better communicator. Verbal IQ is one of the components of an IQ test for a reason. And actually, one of the hallmarks of an intelligent creature is it's ability to communicate.

Also, emotional intelligence doesn't exist. It is pseudo-science and is mistakenly taken as trait agreeableness from the Big 5 personality traits. Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyGKS55PsUI&t=26s

However, the beauty of Fogent Roleplay is that because the rules are so simple, they are easy to modify. If you wish to play in a game where Charisma is an attribute, more power to you!

## Skills

Skills represent the proficiency of certain tasks a character can perform.

### Skill Level

Skill Level measures how good a character is at a specific skill. Skill Level ranges from level -1 to level 5.

| Level | Narrative Meaning |                                                 Description                                                 |
| :---: | :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  -1  |    Incompetent    |                                         Incompetent level of skill.                                         |
|   0   |      Novice      |                                        Inexperienced level of skill.                                        |
|   1   |    Apprentice    |                                        The basics have been learned.                                        |
|   2   |       Adept       |           The basics have been fully understood and the more advanced concepts are being learned.           |
|   3   |      Expert      |    Advanced concepts have been fully understood and master level concepts are beginning to be introduced.    |
|   4   |      Master      | Master level of proficiency has been achieved. Character would be well know in local region for their skill. |
|   5   |     Legendary     |    Legendary level of proficiency has been achieved. Character would be a living legend for their skill.    |

### Skill Specialty

Once a dice pool for a given skill check is equal to or greater than 8 dice you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill, when asked to make a check for that skill with a Challenge Level of 3 or less, you automatically pass if all of the following are true.

- You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influences or aggression such as combat.)
- The check is not contested.
- The check is not a reflexive action.

### Multiple Character skill check

Multiple characters may contribute to the same skill check. The Narrator should then evaluate the Challenge Level in the context of if multiple characters were performing it. All characters make their skill check, from which the average is taken, always rounding down to the nearest whole number. The average will then determine success or failure.

**Example:**

A character wants to pick up an entire large sturdy treasure chest by themselves and take it up a flight of stairs.

The narrator assigns this a Specialized task (CL 3), not only for the weight of the chest but for how cumbersome it is for one person to move. The character gets 2 Wins on their Lift check. They are not able to get the chest up the stairs.

In a parallel dimension, 2 characters decide to pick up the chest. The Narrator assigns this a Common task (CL 1) since people do this every day. The two characters both roll their Lift check. One gets 2 wins and the other gets 1 win. The average is 1.5, which rounds down to 1. They can move the chest up the stairs.

## Core Skills

Core Skills are skills that cover the majority of what most creatures can perform outside of Combat Skills. Core Skills are each governed by an Attribute that it would logically fall under.

### Strength Core Skills

#### Athletics

Represented by sprinters, high jumpers, swimmers and climbers. Covers physical activity related to raw running speed, jump height and general movement. It covers throwing light objects and catching them. Examples include chasing someone, jumping over a pit, swimming in turbulent water, throwing a ball, climbing a rock face, descending a rope or crawling if prone.

#### Endurance

Represented by ultra-marathon runners or low/high temperature extreme athletes. Represents your body's ability to resist physical wounds worsening, toxins, and disease. Examples include staying conscious as you are bleeding out from an injury, resisting poisoning, enduring hot/cold weather, and pushing on past exhaustion are all the domains of endurance.

#### Lift

Represented by strong men or powerlifters. Covers physical activity related to raw strength, most used in moving or holding heavy objects. Examples include shouldering a door open, carrying heavy equipment, throwing heavy objects, or crushing/tearing something in your hands.

### Reflex Core Skills

#### Dexterity

Represented by circus performers, parkourists or cat burglars. Covers movements requiring highly dexterous control over ones body, flexibility, and balance. Dodging, avoiding traps/pitfalls, parkour, backflips, squeezing through tight gaps and walking tightropes are all the domain of Dexterity. Dexterity is also the skill used for riding animals.

#### Perception

Perception is the art of detecting things through the senses, including sight, sound, scent, touch, and taste. It is used as the defense against stealth; it will be common for the Narrator to require players to make environmental 'Perception Checks' to gauge how much the characters notice regarding current happenings or places.

#### Stealth

Represented by ninjas, assassins, and thiefs. Sneaking, hiding from others, and moving with no noise form the basis of the Stealth skill. Stealth can be used for setting up ambushes and laying traps. Stealth is often countered by Perception, and the two forces of hide and seek clash constantly.

### Intelligence Core Skills

#### Communication

Represented by politicians, traders, or con men. It is a measure of your verbal and non-verbal social skills. While anyone can try persuading, deceiving, bartering, or seducing, it is how you communicate that will ultimately entail success or failure. It's not what you say, but how you say it. It also is used to tell if someone is lying or deceiving you.

#### General Knowledge

Represented by historians, bookworms, detectives or street smart individuals. General Knowledge is the art of listening to rumors, recalling information, performing deductive/logical analysis, and applying it where it is needed most. On the street smarts side, it keeps you from going too close to dangerous gang territory, it lets you know who and where to avoid.

A character with a specific knowledge skill (such as a Vocational Skill) strongly related to the task being attempted would always have an easier skill check than a character using General Knowledge. For instance, a baker and a detective are trying to determine which pastry shop made the poisoned box of pastries at a crime scene. The baker using his "Baker Knowledge" skill might only be required to achieve a Common skill check (CL 1) were as the detective using his General Knowledge skill might be required to make a Uncommon skill check (CL 2).

#### Will

Measures a character's mental and spiritual control/strength, exerted to do something or restrain impulses. This could be to do something gross but necessary, resist being verbally, mentally, or spiritually manipulated/attacked, resist being seduced or holding your cool in a scary situation. In a setting with supernatural elements, Will also affects your ability to force yourself to see what is actually beyond the mundane where the mind is generally most comfortable.

## Vocations

Vocations represent your character's job, class, or life path. You should check with your Narrator to make sure that your Vocation exists in the setting. Some traditional fantasy examples Vocations are Rogue, Knight, Wizard, Paladin, Cleric, etc... Other examples include Vagrant, Chef, or Sailor. Each vocation has one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it.

### Vocation Level

Vocation Level measures how good a character is at a specific vocation. Vocation Level ranges from level -1 to level 5.

| Level | Narrative Meaning |                                                   Description                                                   |

### Vocation Skills

All skills under a Vocation have their levels capped by the Vocation's level. For instance, if a character had a level 2 Vocation, any skill under it couldn't increase above 2, until its Vocation level increased.

Each skill under a Vocation has one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it. A skill under a Vocation can have different Governing Attributes than the Vocation's Governing Attributes. Two kinds of skills fall under a Vocation, Vocational Skills and Combat Skills.

#### Combat Skills

Combat skills include all Weapon Combat Skills and Magic Skills. These skills require skill points to be increased.

#### Vocational Skills

Vocational Skills are skills that your Vocation would logically give you. A Vocational Skill's level is inherited from Vocation's level. Players can make Vocational Skills at any point with approval from the Narrator and use them for applicable skill checks.

Vocational Skills will often overlap with one or more Core Skills, though they will represent a much more specialized subset of tasks. Often times a Vocational Skill will combine what would usually be multiple sequential harder Core Skill checks into a single often easier Vocational Skill check.

Vocational Skills can never cover a majority of what a Core Skill covers. You can not assist Vocational Skills with the Vocation they fall under, as they are essentially relying on the same shared skill point investment.

It is smart to write down Vocational Skills under your vocation as a reminder to have on your character sheet.

**Vocational Skills Examples:**

Below are some example of Vocational Skills for certain Vocations with examples of the sequence of Core Skills that would be used if a character didn't have the Vocational Skill in question. Based off what Core Skills a character would've had to performed, you can usually infer what Governing Attributes the Vocational Skill will have.

### Example Vocation

Our example character has 0 STR, 1 RFX, and 1 INT. I take the Vocation "Chef" and give it the Governing Attributes of RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as chefs have to use their senses to smell, taste, and quick fine motor control of their hands. INT makes sense as they have to have a vast knowledge of recipes and flavor combinations. I increase the Vocation level to level 2. My "Chef" vocation dice pool is 7d6.

I add the "Wine Tasting" Vocational Skill and give it the Governing Attributes of RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use their sense to smell and taste for the wine. INT makes sense as they'd have to have a vast knowledge of wine types and have knowledge of what were good years when the grapes were grown. "Wine Tasting" is also not covered by any other Core Skill. I inherited the level for "Wine Tasting" at level 2 as it shares the level of my "Chef" vocation.

I try to make "Chopping Food" a vocational skill and give it the governing attribute RFX. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use fine motor control with their hands to chop quickly.

I try to add the "Small Blade" combat skill which has the governing attributes STR, RFX, and INT. This makes sense as being stronger, faster, and smarter makes you more deadly with a knife. It also makes sense that a Chef would know how to use a knife. I spend 1 skill point on it, bringing it to level 1.

I try and add the "Reach Spear" combat skill. I realized using a long spear is not something that a chef would do, so I can't add it under my vocation.

| Chef             |   RFX, INT   |     2     | 7d6 |
| ---------------- | :-----------: | :-------: | :-: |
| Wine Tasting     |   RFX, INT   | Inherited | 7d6 |
| Chopping Food    |      RFX      | Inherited | 6d6 |
| Small Blade      | STR, RFX, INT |     1     | 7d6 |
| ~~Reach Spear~~ | STR, RFX, INT |          |    |

## Tied Contested Checks

Contested Checks occur when two character's actions conflict. The most obvious example of this is fighting, though other examples include drinking contests, arm wrestling, or stealth vs perception. Oftentimes, Contested Checks result in ties. If ties occur within combat, ties result in neither side making progress and the contested check is a stalemate. Otherwise, ties in any other contested check outside of combat can just be rerolled to establish a clear winner.

**Combat example 1:**

Two characters are in combat and roll their dice pools versus one another. Each of them gets 2 wins on their combat roll. They clash but aren't able to injure each other.

**Combat example 2:**

A rogue and a knight are fighting each other in combat. The rogue wants to use the dim light of the room to get around the knight and sneak attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contested check is a stalemate and the rogue is not able to enter into stealth. Looks like he'll have to fight him without the aid of the shadows this round.

**Combat example 3:**

A rogue and a knight are fighting each other in combat. The rogue has already used the dim light of the room to successfully hide behind some crates last round. The knight declares he is trying to find the rogue on his turn and attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contest check is a stalemate and the rogue remains hidden. The rogue uses his stealth to sneak attack the knight.

**Non-combat example:**

Outside of combat, a rogue is trying to sneak up on a knight. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. They reroll to determine a clear winner.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage and Disadvantage represent circumstances that favor or disfavor a character, resulting in better or worse odds of achieving Wins.

Advantages and Disadvantages only apply to a single dice pool, not additional dice pools such as from Assists. For example, if a character has Advantage on a Stealth check and decides to assist with their "Rogue" vocation, then the Advantage only applies to the Stealth dice pool and not to the "Rogue" dice pool. However, the character could preemptively use a destiny point to gain Advantage on the "Rogue" assist dice pool.

### Advantage

Advantage is gained when circumstance favors a character. For any dice rolled, 3's count as wins for that roll.

### Disadvantage

Disadvantage is gained when circumstance disfavors a character. For any dice rolled, 4's count as failures for that roll.

### Super Advantage

Gained under very specific conditions when the stars have aligned for your character. For any dice rolled, 3s and 2s count as wins for that roll.

### Super Disadvantage

Gained under very specific conditions when your character has drawn the short straw. For any dice rolled, 4's and 5's count as failures for that roll.

### Super Advantage/Disadvantage overriding Advantage/Disadvantage

Super Advantage/Disadvantage completely overrides Advantage and Disadvantage on any roll.

### Advantages and Disadvantages cancelling out

If on a roll a character had both Advantage and Disadvantage, the two effects cancel out leaving you with only a normal roll. If a character had two sources giving you Advantage, then you would still only have Advantage. However, if the character had two sources of Advantage and one source of Disadvantage, then one advantage would cancel out with the only disadvantage, leaving you with Advantage.

In the extreme case that a character has Super Advantage and Super Disadvantage, they cancel out the same way Advantage and Disadvantage do.
