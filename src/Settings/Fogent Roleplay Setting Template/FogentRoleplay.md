# Introduction

## Welcome to Fogent Roleplay

Welcome to Fogent Roleplay.

Fogent Roleplay is a setting agnostic TTRPG (Table Top Roleplay Game) that is intended to remove the unneeded complexity common in many TTRPGs while not sacrificing emergent/tactical gameplay. If you love the simplicity, flexibility, and narrative focus of Cogent Roleplay, but love tactical battle map combat, magic items, campaign progression, and sweet loot, then you are in the right place.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then D&D:

- **Setting Agnostic:** Unlike most TTRPGs, Fogent Roleplay and it's rules aren't tied any setting. It is designed from the ground up to easily run games in existing settings or in brand-new ones you create. This way, your group can learn one easy-to-use system to play in various settings such as medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, galactic warfare, survival horror, etc... This makes Fogent Roleplay great for world builders and authors looking to collaboratively create/reveal their worlds.
- **Elegant and Intuitive Rules:** While other TTRPGs require multiple books worth of rules to play, by contrast, Fogent Roleplay has ~40 pages of core rules, much of which consist of examples. This makes Fogent Roleplay extremely easy for new Players/Narrators to pick up.
- **Narrative Focused:** Most TTRPGs feel very different in and out of combat, with non-combat roleplay having great narrative flow where your character can attempt almost anything, but once combat is entered it feels more like a video game where characters can only perform the exact actions as described in the rules. Fogent Roleplay elegantly handles combat within the narrative flow while still having balanced/tactical combat. Combat in Fogent Roleplay feels more like an awesome fight scene in a movie, rather than video game characters just trying to get each other to 0 HP.
- **Off Loading Complexity to the Narrative:** The rules are purposefully built to off load as much complexity to the narrative as possible. Instead of every rule complexity/edge case turing into a legal battle between the players and narrator, it just becomes a discussion about what would narratively make sense. Therefore, what is best for your character in terms of the context of the rules, what logically makes sense in the world, and what is most narratively satisfying are the same thing in Fogent Roleplay!
- **Making the Narrator's Easy:** Fogent Roleplay is neither designed to nor intends to have a rule for every minute situation. Instead, we want to give the Narrator a multi-tool of powerful, flexible, and intuitive rules. We want a Narrator's pre-game prep to primarily consist of creating insane plot twists, designing cool combat encounters, crafting awesome magic items, figuring out how the a player character's backstory ties into the story, ect... rather than spending hours understanding rules.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then Cogent Roleplay:

* **Innovation:** Whether it be rebalanced Core Skills, reworked Vocations, rebalanced weapons, an Advantage/Disadvantage system, rebalanced destiny point rules, automated character sheet support, etc... Fogent Roleplay has taken the best ideas of Cogent Roleplay to their logical conclusions while embracing innovation.
* **Tactical Battlemap Combat:** Fogent Roleplay has rules to be run on a battlemap. This allows for awesome tactical fight scenes where a character's positioning and surrounding environment factor into combat. While Fogent Roleplay can be run in the theater of the mind, it works even better on a battlemap.
* **Mature Ruleset:** Fogent Roleplay provides a mature and robust ruleset with no mechanical edge cases (if you can find one, please let us know). Not only were the rules battle-tested via 100+ sessions durning it's development, most of the rules have been converted into code equivalent logic. Since the resulting software works, the rules are mechanically robust.
* **Magic System Template:** The Magic System Template allows for the easy creation of balanced magic systems regardless of the setting.
* **Pre-made Settings:** If you don't have the time to come up with an entire setting for your players to play in, Fogent Roleplay comes with pre-made campaign settings. This is an ongoing effort with more becoming available over time.

May your stories be epic,

-Javk "The Forever Narrator" Wick

# General Rules

## Dice Pools

A Dice Pool is a collection of one or more dice that when rolled determines how many "Wins" where achieved for whatever task was being attempted. D6 dice (otherwise known as six-sided dice) are the most common dice used, though D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are also used.

After the Dice Pool has been rolled, you sum up the amount of "Wins" from the roll. Any rolled dice that gets a 4 or greater counts as a win. D6 dice have a 50% chance of rolling a win, as 4, 5, and 6 on the dice are wins. D4s only have a 25% chance of a win, since only the 4 on the dice counts as a win. In general, the more dice and the more faces the dice have, the better the chances are of getting more wins.

| Dice Type | Probability of Win |
| :-------: | :----------------: |
|    D4    |        25%        |
|    D6    |        50%        |
|    D8    |       62.5%       |
|    D10    |        70%        |
|    D12    |        75%        |
|    D20    |        85%        |

All Dice Pools start with their "Base Dice", which by default are 3d6. You then add a D6 for each skill point, attribute point, or additional modifier that governs the Dice Pool.

Whenever you are removing dice from a dice pool (often done after taking an injury), always remove the lowest-sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.

## Challenge Level

Challenge Level represents the difficulty of a task set by the narrator proportionate to an **AVERAGE PERSON OF THE WORLD**. If a character is able to get enough wins to meet or beat the challenge level, they succeeded.

|      Difficulty      | Challenge Level |
| :------------------: | :-------------: |
|       Trivial       |      CL 0      |
|        Common        |      CL 1      |
|       Uncommon       |      CL 2      |
|     Specialized     |      CL 3      |
|      Difficult      |      CL 4      |
| Extremely Difficult |      CL 5      |
|     Unrealistic     |      CL 6      |
| Virtually Impossible |      CL 7      |
|    Inconceivable    |      CL 8      |
|      Legendary      |      CL 9      |

Pay attention the names of each Challenge Level. They are intended help Narrators and Players both intuitively understand how hard something should be within the narrative of the story.

For example, Javk Wick the Rogue hoist his unconscious injured ally onto his shoulders to get them both to safety. The Narrator determines that picking up someones limp body and getting them to your shoulders is neither a "Trivial" or "Common" thing for the average person to do. The Narrator sets the Challenge Level at "Uncommon" (CL 2) using the Lift Skill. If the ally was instead conscious, the Narrator might only set the Challenge Level to "Common" (CL 1) as hoisting an unconscious limp is far harder than a conscious compliant one.

## Attributes

Attributes represent the innate characteristics of a character. An attribute can go from level -2 to level 5. Each level corresponds with a narrative significance.

| Attribute Level |                      Narrative Meaning                      |
| :-------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |            Painfully lacking in the attribute.            |
|       -1       |            Below an average person in our world.            |
|        0        |               An average person in our world.               |
|        1        |              Professional or naturally gifted.              |
|        2        | Elite or 'world-class'. Peak of real world human potential. |
|        3        |                Meta-human or genetic anomaly                |
|        4        |                        Demigod like                        |
|        5        |                Peak achievable or god like.                |

### Strength (STR)

Represents a character's innate muscle strength, bone density, tendon strength, physical durability, etc...

| Attribute Level |            Narrative Meaning            |
| :-------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                A squirrel                |
|       -1       |   Below an average person in our world   |
|        0        |      An average person in our world      |
|        1        |      Professional soldier or knight      |
|        2        | World's strongest man champion or Batman |
|        3        |     Bear, Ogre, or Captain America     |
|        4        |                 Hercules                 |
|        5        |                 Superman                 |

STR has the following effects:

- STR is factored into all STR Governed Skills (Athletics, Endurance, Lift, etc...). Greater STR can help a character move more in a combat round and carry heavier gear without being penalized.
- STR is a character's physical and bodily durability. In combat, for every point in STR a character can reduce a victory level achieved against them from physical (bludgeon, slash, pierce, etc...) or bodily (poisons, cold, etc...) damage types once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every point in STR a character can reduce a physical or bodily damage type injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of respite between each injury.

### Reflex (RFX)

Represents a character's innate reflexes, reaction speed, nervous system, fine motor control, nimbleness, agility, quickness...

| Attribute Level |                 Narrative Meaning                 |
| :-------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                  A sea cucumber                  |
|       -1       |       Below an average person in our world       |
|        0        |          An average person in our world          |
|        1        | Professional thief, parkourist, or circus acrobat |
|        2        |    Gold medal gymnast or master martial artist    |
|        3        |                      Legolas                      |
|        4        |                     Spiderman                     |
|        5        |                The Flash or Hermes                |

RFX has the following effects:

- RFX is factored into all RFX Governed Skills (Dexterity, Perception, Stealth, etc...).
- As combat is conducted in a round-by-round format, the player with the highest RFX gets priority in that round.
- RFX allows characters to move before slower characters and increases all Combat Speeds.

### Intelligence (INT)

Represents a character's innate raw mental horsepower, IQ, consciousness, and mental/spiritual durability.

| Attribute Level |                           Narrative Meaning                           | Skill Points Gained/Lost Total |
| :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|       -2       |                               A zombie                               |               -3               |
|       -1       |                 Below an average person in our world                 |               -1               |
|        0        |                    An average person in our world                    |               0               |
|        1        |           University science professor or career politician           |               1               |
|        2        | Award-winning particle physicist or 'Sherlock Holmes' level detective |               3               |
|        3        |                              Tony Stark                              |               6               |
|        4        |                           Ultron or Skynet                           |               10               |
|        5        |                       Dr. Manhattan or Athena                       |               15               |

INT has the following effects:

- INT is factored into all INT Governed Skills (General Knowledge, Willpower, Communication, etc...).
- Starting at 0, for every INT point a player receives, they gain the same amount of additional skill points to spend. This effect is cumulative, refer to the "Skill Points Gained/Lost" to the total amount of skill points for a given INT level.
- INT is a measure of how durable a character's consciousness is to mental and spiritual attacks. In combat, for every point in INT a character can reduce a victory level achieved against them from spiritual or psychic damage types once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every point in INT a character can reduce a spiritual or psychic damage type injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of respite between each injury.

### Why is there no Charisma Attribute

INT governs the "Communications" skill which is essentially your classical charisma stat. The reality is that being smarter makes you a better communicator. Verbal IQ is one of the components of an IQ test for a reason. And actually, one of the hallmarks of an intelligent creature is it's ability to communicate.

Also, emotional intelligence doesn't exist. It is pseudo-science and is mistakenly taken as trait agreeableness from the Big 5 personality traits. Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyGKS55PsUI&t=26s

However, the beauty of Fogent Roleplay is that because the rules are so simple, they are easy to modify. If you wish to play in a game where Charisma is an attribute, more power to you!

## Skills

Skills represent the proficiency of certain tasks a character can perform.

### Skill Level

Skill Level measures how good a character is at a specific skill. Skill Level ranges from level -1 to level 5.

| Level | Narrative Meaning |                                                 Description                                                 |
| :---: | :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  -1  |    Incompetent    |                                         Incompetent level of skill.                                         |
|   0   |      Novice      |                                        Inexperienced level of skill.                                        |
|   1   |    Apprentice    |                                        The basics have been learned.                                        |
|   2   |       Adept       |           The basics have been fully understood and the more advanced concepts are being learned.           |
|   3   |      Expert      |    Advanced concepts have been fully understood and master level concepts are beginning to be introduced.    |
|   4   |      Master      | Master level of proficiency has been achieved. Character would be well know in local region for their skill. |
|   5   |     Legendary     |    Legendary level of proficiency has been achieved. Character would be a living legend for their skill.    |

### Skill Specialty

Once a dice pool for a given skill check is equal to or greater than 8 dice you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill, when asked to make a check for that skill with a Challenge Level of 3 or less, you automatically pass if all of the following are true.

- You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influences or aggression such as combat.)
- The check is not contested.
- The check is not a reflexive action.

### Multiple Character skill check

Multiple characters may contribute to the same skill check. The Narrator should then evaluate the Challenge Level in the context of if multiple characters were performing it. All characters make their skill check, from which the average is taken, always rounding down to the nearest whole number. The average will then determine success or failure.

**Example:**

A character wants to pick up an entire large sturdy treasure chest by themselves and take it up a flight of stairs.

The narrator assigns this a Specialized task (CL 3), not only for the weight of the chest but for how cumbersome it is for one person to move. The character gets 2 Wins on their Lift check. They are not able to get the chest up the stairs.

In a parallel dimension, 2 characters decide to pick up the chest. The Narrator assigns this a Common task (CL 1) since people do this every day. The two characters both roll their Lift check. One gets 2 wins and the other gets 1 win. The average is 1.5, which rounds down to 1. They can move the chest up the stairs.

## Core Skills

Core Skills are skills that cover the majority of what most creatures can perform outside of Combat Skills. Core Skills are each governed by an Attribute that it would logically fall under.

### Strength Core Skills

#### Athletics

Represented by sprinters, high jumpers, swimmers and climbers. Covers physical activity related to raw running speed, jump height and general movement. It covers throwing light objects and catching them. Examples include chasing someone, jumping over a pit, swimming in turbulent water, throwing a ball, climbing a rock face, descending a rope or crawling if prone.

#### Endurance

Represented by ultra-marathon runners or low/high temperature extreme athletes. Represents your body's ability to resist physical wounds worsening, toxins, and disease. Examples include staying conscious as you are bleeding out from an injury, resisting poisoning, enduring hot/cold weather, and pushing on past exhaustion are all the domains of endurance.

#### Lift

Represented by strong men or powerlifters. Covers physical activity related to raw strength, most used in moving or holding heavy objects. Examples include shouldering a door open, carrying heavy equipment, throwing heavy objects, or crushing/tearing something in your hands.

### Reflex Core Skills

#### Dexterity

Represented by circus performers, parkourists or cat burglars. Covers movements requiring highly dexterous control over ones body, flexibility, and balance. Dodging, avoiding traps/pitfalls, parkour, backflips, squeezing through tight gaps and walking tightropes are all the domain of Dexterity. Dexterity is also the skill used for riding animals.

#### Perception

Perception is the art of detecting things through the senses, including sight, sound, scent, touch, and taste. It is used as the defense against stealth; it will be common for the Narrator to require players to make environmental 'Perception Checks' to gauge how much the characters notice regarding current happenings or places.

#### Stealth

Represented by ninjas, assassins, and thiefs. Sneaking, hiding from others, and moving with no noise form the basis of the Stealth skill. Stealth can be used for setting up ambushes and laying traps. Stealth is often countered by Perception, and the two forces of hide and seek clash constantly.

### Intelligence Core Skills

#### Communication

Represented by politicians, traders, or con men. It is a measure of your verbal and non-verbal social skills. While anyone can try persuading, deceiving, bartering, or seducing, it is how you communicate that will ultimately entail success or failure. It's not what you say, but how you say it. It also is used to tell if someone is lying or deceiving you.

#### General Knowledge

Represented by historians, bookworms, detectives or street smart individuals. General Knowledge is the art of listening to rumors, recalling information, performing deductive/logical analysis, and applying it where it is needed most. On the street smarts side, it keeps you from going too close to dangerous gang territory, it lets you know who and where to avoid.

A character with a specific knowledge skill (such as a Vocational Skill) strongly related to the task being attempted would always have an easier skill check than a character using General Knowledge. For instance, a baker and a detective are trying to determine which pastry shop made the poisoned box of pastries at a crime scene. The baker using his "Baker Knowledge" skill might only be required to achieve a Common skill check (CL 1) were as the detective using his General Knowledge skill might be required to make a Uncommon skill check (CL 2).

#### Will

Measures a character's mental and spiritual control/strength, exerted to do something or restrain impulses. This could be to do something gross but necessary, resist being verbally, mentally, or spiritually manipulated/attacked, resist being seduced or holding your cool in a scary situation. In a setting with supernatural elements, Will also affects your ability to force yourself to see what is actually beyond the mundane where the mind is generally most comfortable.

## Vocations

Vocations represent your character's job, class, or life path. You should check with your Narrator to make sure that your Vocation exists in the setting. Some traditional fantasy examples Vocations are Rogue, Knight, Wizard, Paladin, Cleric, etc... Other examples include Vagrant, Chef, or Sailor. Each vocation has one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it.

### Vocation Level

Vocation Level measures how good a character is at a specific vocation. Vocation Level ranges from level -1 to level 5.

| Level | Narrative Meaning |                                                   Description                                                   |

|   5   |     Legendary     |    Legendary level of proficiency has been achieved. Character would be a living legend for their vocation.    |

### Vocation Skills

All skills under a Vocation have their levels capped by the Vocation's level. For instance, if a character had a level 2 Vocation, any skill under it couldn't increase above 2, until its Vocation level increased.

Each skill under a Vocation has one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it. A skill under a Vocation can have different Governing Attributes than the Vocation's Governing Attributes. Two kinds of skills fall under a Vocation, Vocational Skills and Combat Skills.

#### Combat Skills

Combat skills include all Weapon Combat Skills and Magic Skills. These skills require skill points to be increased.

#### Vocational Skills

Vocational Skills are skills that your Vocation would logically give you. A Vocational Skill's level is inherited from Vocation's level. Players can make Vocational Skills at any point with approval from the Narrator and use them for applicable skill checks.

Vocational Skills will often overlap with one or more Core Skills, though they will represent a much more specialized subset of tasks. Often times a Vocational Skill will combine what would usually be multiple sequential harder Core Skill checks into a single often easier Vocational Skill check.

Vocational Skills can never cover a majority of what a Core Skill covers. You can not assist Vocational Skills with the Vocation they fall under, as they are essentially relying on the same shared skill point investment.

It is smart to write down Vocational Skills under your vocation as a reminder to have on your character sheet.

**Vocational Skills Examples:**

Below are some example of Vocational Skills for certain Vocations with examples of the sequence of Core Skills that would be used if a character didn't have the Vocational Skill in question. Based off what Core Skills a character would've had to performed, you can usually infer what Governing Attributes the Vocational Skill will have.

### Example Vocation

Our example character has 0 STR, 1 RFX, and 1 INT. I take the Vocation "Chef" and give it the Governing Attributes of RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as chefs have to use their senses to smell, taste, and quick fine motor control of their hands. INT makes sense as they have to have a vast knowledge of recipes and flavor combinations. I increase the Vocation level to level 2. My "Chef" vocation dice pool is 7d6.

I add the "Wine Tasting" Vocational Skill and give it the Governing Attributes of RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use their sense to smell and taste for the wine. INT makes sense as they'd have to have a vast knowledge of wine types and have knowledge of what were good years when the grapes were grown. "Wine Tasting" is also not covered by any other Core Skill. I inherited the level for "Wine Tasting" at level 2 as it shares the level of my "Chef" vocation.

I try to make "Chopping Food" a vocational skill and give it the governing attribute RFX. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use fine motor control with their hands to chop quickly.

I try to add the "Small Blade" combat skill which has the governing attributes STR, RFX, and INT. This makes sense as being stronger, faster, and smarter makes you more deadly with a knife. It also makes sense that a Chef would know how to use a knife. I spend 1 skill point on it, bringing it to level 1.

I try and add the "Reach Spear" combat skill. I realized using a long spear is not something that a chef would do, so I can't add it under my vocation.

| Chef             |   RFX, INT   |     2     | 7d6 |
| ---------------- | :-----------: | :-------: | :-: |
| Wine Tasting     |   RFX, INT   | Inherited | 7d6 |
| Chopping Food    |      RFX      | Inherited | 6d6 |
| Small Blade      | STR, RFX, INT |     1     | 7d6 |
| ~~Reach Spear~~ | STR, RFX, INT |          |    |

## Tied Contested Checks

Contested Checks occur when two character's actions conflict. The most obvious example of this is fighting, though other examples include drinking contests, arm wrestling, or stealth vs perception. Oftentimes, Contested Checks result in ties. If ties occur within combat, ties result in neither side making progress and the contested check is a stalemate. Otherwise, ties in any other contested check outside of combat can just be rerolled to establish a clear winner.

**Combat example 1:**

Two characters are in combat and roll their dice pools versus one another. Each of them gets 2 wins on their combat roll. They clash but aren't able to injure each other.

**Combat example 2:**

A rogue and a knight are fighting each other in combat. The rogue wants to use the dim light of the room to get around the knight and sneak attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contested check is a stalemate and the rogue is not able to enter into stealth. Looks like he'll have to fight him without the aid of the shadows this round.

**Combat example 3:**

A rogue and a knight are fighting each other in combat. The rogue has already used the dim light of the room to successfully hide behind some crates last round. The knight declares he is trying to find the rogue on his turn and attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contest check is a stalemate and the rogue remains hidden. The rogue uses his stealth to sneak attack the knight.

**Non-combat example:**

Outside of combat, a rogue is trying to sneak up on a knight. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. They reroll to determine a clear winner.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage and Disadvantage represent circumstances that favor or disfavor a character, resulting in better or worse odds of achieving Wins.

Advantages and Disadvantages only apply to a single dice pool, not additional dice pools such as from Assists. For example, if a character has Advantage on a Stealth check and decides to assist with their "Rogue" vocation, then the Advantage only applies to the Stealth dice pool and not to the "Rogue" dice pool. However, the character could preemptively use a destiny point to gain Advantage on the "Rogue" assist dice pool.

### Advantage

Advantage is gained when circumstance favors a character. For any dice rolled, 3's count as wins for that roll.

### Disadvantage

Disadvantage is gained when circumstance disfavors a character. For any dice rolled, 4's count as failures for that roll.

### Super Advantage

Gained under very specific conditions when the stars have aligned for your character. For any dice rolled, 3s and 2s count as wins for that roll.

### Super Disadvantage

Gained under very specific conditions when your character has drawn the short straw. For any dice rolled, 4's and 5's count as failures for that roll.

### Super Advantage/Disadvantage overriding Advantage/Disadvantage

Super Advantage/Disadvantage completely overrides Advantage and Disadvantage on any roll.

### Advantages and Disadvantages cancelling out

If on a roll a character had both Advantage and Disadvantage, the two effects cancel out leaving you with only a normal roll. If a character had two sources giving you Advantage, then you would still only have Advantage. However, if the character had two sources of Advantage and one source of Disadvantage, then one advantage would cancel out with the only disadvantage, leaving you with Advantage.

In the extreme case that a character has Super Advantage and Super Disadvantage, they cancel out the same way Advantage and Disadvantage do.

## Assists

With Assists, characters can give Advantage (or if rolled poorly, Disadvantage) with an "assisting" Dice Pool to a "primary" Dice Pool. Characters can Assist themselves or another character. The "assisting" Dice Pools must be rolled first. The "assisting" Dice Pool can be a Skill or Vocation. The "primary" Dice Pool can be a Skill or Combat Roll.

It must make logical sense to the Narrator as to why the "assisting" Dice Pool would aid the "primary" Dice Pool. Player's should recognize when they are stretching logic and Narrators should recognize when the player's come up with creative applications of assists. It's up to the players and the Narrator to explain/negotiate how these assists make logical sense for the current circumstance.

Assists can never use the same Skill for the "assisting" and "primary" Dice Pools. For instance, a character could never assist another character's Lift Check with their own Lift Check, they would instead use the [Multiple Character Skill Check](./Skills.md#multiple-character-skill-check) rules.

Multiple characters can assist the same "primary" Dice Pool. If they are assisting using the same skill, then there assists rolls will use the Multiple Character Skill Check rules for that assist. If they are using different skills/vocations as assists, handle each assist roll separately before seeing if the resulting Advantages/Disadvantages cancel out, with whatever remains being applied to the "primary" Dice Pool.

**The CL for Assists starts at CL 3 and should ALMOST NEVER be lower than that.** However, it is up to the narrator to decide if it should be higher than CL 3. In general, most Assists, unless extremely unlikely to aid the current situation, will be made at CL 3.

If the "assisting" Dice Pool achieved more Wins than the Assist CL, Advantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool. If the "assisting" Dice Pool achieved Wins equal to the Assist CL, neither advantage or disadvantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool. If the Assist check achieved fewer Wins than the Assists CL, Disadvantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool.

**Example 1:**

Thrak the Barbarian is trying to lift a big rock. Bob the Bard decides he is going to play some motivational music on his guitar to Assist Thrak. In this example, Thrak's Lift is the "primary" Dice Pool and Bob's Performance Vocational Skill is the "assisting" Dice Pool.

The Narrator agrees as it makes logical sense. The narrator sets a CL 3 Performance Check for the assists. Bob rolls his Performance Vocational skill and gets 4 wins, resulting in Advantage for Thrak's Lift Check. In a parallel reality, Bob only gets 3 wins, and his song doesn't help or hurt Thrak's Check. In another parallel reality, Bob only gets 2 wins on his Performance Check, which produces such horrible music it distracts Thrak resulting in Disadvantage to Thrak's Lift Check.

**Example 2:**

Javk Wick the rogue is sneaking up on a guard. Javk's player asks the narrator if he could assist his Stealth check to sneak up with his Rogue Vocation. He asks the Narrator if he could Assist his Stealth check with his Rogue Vocation since being a good Rogue would aid his sneakiness. In this example, Stealth is the "primary" Dice Pool and Rogue is the "assisting" Dice Pool.

The Narrator agrees as it makes logical sense. The Narrator sets the CL of the Assist at 3. Javk gets 4 Wins from his Assist, giving him advantage on his Stealth check.

**Example 3:**

Javk Wick the rogue is in combat. He wants to do some fancy foot work combined with acrobatic maneuvers to give him an edge as he uses his dagger in a melee clash as slippery oil patches cover the floor. Javk's player asks the narrator if he could assist his dagger's combat roll with his Dexterity skill. In this example, Dexterity is the "primary" Dice Pool and the dagger's combat roll is the "assisting" Dice Pool.

The Narrator agrees, setting the assist to CL 3 due to the slippery oil patches cover the floor. Javk gets 4 Wins from his Assist, giving him advantage on his dagger's combat roll.

## Base Dice Tiers

Base dice are always represented by 3 dice, which by default are 3d6. However, base dice can change for better or worse depending on a Base Dice Tier.

Base Dice Tiers show up in [Weapon Base Dice Tiers](./../CombatRules/Weapons.md#weapon-base-dice-tier) and [Skill Base Dice Tiers](./../AdvancedRules/Effects.md#skill-base-dice-tier).

|    Name    | Tier | Base Dice |

|   Broken   |  -4  |    0d6    |
| Compromised |  -3  |    3d4    |

|    Epic    |  9  |    3d12    |
|  Legendary  |  10  | 1d20, 2d12 |
|   Mythic   |  11  | 2d20, 1d12 |
|  Artifact  |  12  |    3d20    |

## Destiny Points

A Destiny Point represents a player's ability to tip the scales of fate in favor of their character.

Destiny Point Effects are for the following two kinds of characters:

- Player Characters are given "Destiny Points" and "Destiny Resistance" by default. "Destiny Points" allows players to influence the story at key moments they decide. "Destiny Resistance" is mainly to prevent Player Characters from wasting all there Destiny Points against one another on silly rolls.
- Villain/Boss NPC can be given different combinations of these effects to dramatically increase how dangerous they are. Nothing scares players quite like telling them Destiny Points don't work versus a powerful foe...

Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the narrator wants to encourage.

- Players showing up to the game on time
- Exceptional roleplay
- Accomplishing a major milestone (defeating a boss or completing a quest)
- Doing something in line with their character's personality even if at the detriment of wealth or progress

## Defense

Depending on the damage type, different types of defense can be used to reduce injuries. A character can then reduce an injury level by the equivalent amount of defense they have to that damage type.

### Physical Defense

A measure of a character's defense to all physical injuries. Calculated by summing all a character's physical defenses and rounding down. A character can wear two pieces of armor in the same category, such as wearing a gambeson under chain mail or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history. In these circumstances, the most efficient way of defeating a person in heavy armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life.

If a combat roll has a Physical damage type and a Bodily, Mental, or Spiritual damage type, then since it is combined with the physical attack it is only versus physical defense. An example would be poison applied to the blade of a weapon.

#### Armor Types

Armor Type determines what portions of a character a piece of armor will protect. There are 4 different armor types.

- Head
- Body
- Arm
- Leg
- Shield

#### Shields

The class of "Shield" marks an item that can be used as a shield for defensive purposes. This takes up one of the character's hands when in use.

Characters not actively using their shield as part of their combat/dodge roll do not benefit from the additional defense. Characters that are Off Guard or being attacked while unaware also do not benefit from the shield's defense.

### Bodily Defense

A measure of a character's defense to injury from Bodily damage types. Determines your body's ability to resist poisoning, bleeding, freezing, etc. Wins determined by an Endurance skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of the dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the number of dice rolled by 2 and then rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

### Mental Defense

A measure of a character's defense to injury from Mental damage types. Wins determined by a Will skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of their dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the number of dice rolled by 2 and then rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

### Soul Defense

A measure of a character's defense to injury from Soul damage types. Wins determined by a Will skill check act as your defense against injury. The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of their dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the number of dice rolled by 2 and then rounding down. The wins achieved by this are reduced by an attacker's combat roll penetration.

## Penetration

The only way to injure an opponent with a specific Defense Type is to exceed or penetrate it.

Penetration represents a Combat Roll's ability to mitigate the opponent's Defense. While dealing an injury, you may reduce your opponent's Defense level by your Combat Roll's Penetration before calculating injury.

For penetration versus Physical Defense, primarily being armor, weapons with strong Penetration include bludgeoning weapons such as a mace or war hammer, which historically were one of the primary ways of defeating heavy armor. To a lesser extent, thrusting weapons such as daggers or spears also have decent Penetration versus physical defense, as they can be used to thrust into weak points in armor. Slashing swords would have some of the worst penetration, as it is highly unlikely to be able to slice through the armor.

For penetration versus Bodily, Mental, and Soul Defense, Penetration represents the attack's effect being harder to resist. For instance, it is far easier to resist taking injury from a single poison bolt versus being covered in a poison mist area of effect.

## Range

Each Range represents a calculation which given the number of dice in a Skill Dice Pool calculates the Effective Range, Ineffective Range, and Max Range. Therefor, as a character's Weapon/Magic Skill improves, so does the range at which it can be used.

Effective Range, Ineffective Range, and Max Range are usually represented on a character sheet in the "(Effective Range)/(Ineffective Range)/(Max Range)" format. For example, "100/200/400" translates to an Effective Range of 100 ft, an Ineffective Range of 200 ft, and a Max Range of 400 ft.

### Range Types

|     Name     | Effective Range Per Dice (ft) |
| :----------: | :---------------------------: |
|     Near     |             1.67             |

### Effective Range

The distance up to which you are effective.

Effective Range = (Effective Range Per Dice) * (Number of Skill Dice), rounded down to the nearest multipe of 5

From 0 ft up to the Effective Range, Disadvantage is NOT gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.

### Ineffective Range

It is the distance up to which your effectiveness is only partially degraded.

Ineffective Range = (Effective Range) * 2

Past the Effective Range and up to the Ineffective Range, Disadvantage is gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.

### Max Range

It is the maximum distance that can be targeted with the characters current skill.

Max Range = (Effective Range) * 4

Past the Ineffective Range up to the Max Range, Super Disadvantage is gained on Dice Pool the skill is being used in.

## Uses Per Round

Uses Per Round represent the number of times some skill governed action can be preformed in a round.

This rule is mainly used for determining how many times a weapon/spell can be used in combat rounds. In this context, if a character depeletes their Uses Per Round provided by their weapon/spell, then they can no longer use that weapon/spell that combat round and are instead forced to dodge if they are being attacked.

### Uses Per Round calculations

Uses Per Round is calculated using the following equation:

( (Number of Skill Dice) + (Dice Amount Adjustment) )/ (Combat Roll Divisor), rounded down to the nearest whole number only if above 1, to a maximum of (Max Uses Per Round Option)

|      Name      | Combat Roll Divisor | Dice Amount Adjustment | Max Uses Per Round Option |
| :------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|     Rapid     |          1          |           0           |           None           |
|    Swift +2    |          2          |           2           |           None           |
|    Swift +1    |          2          |           1           |           None           |
|     Swift     |          2          |           0           |           None           |
|     Quick     |          3          |           0           |           None           |
|     Steady     |          4          |           0           |           None           |
|     Paced     |          5          |           0           |           None           |
|      Slow      |          6          |           0           |           None           |
| Extremely Slow |          8          |           0           |           None           |
| Painfully Slow |         16         |           0           |           None           |

For example, if a character had 7 dice in their governing skill dice pool with an Uses Per Round of "Quick", 7 divided by 3 is 2.333, which rounded down is 2. There is non "Max UPR" for "Quick" so they would have 2 Uses Per Round for that round.

#### Uses Per Round calculations resulting in less than 1

On a round where an action IS prepared (example: your Heavy Crossbow is loaded), you can perform the action 1 time.

On a round where an action is NOT prepared (example: your Heavy Crossbow is unloaded), if the Uses Per Round calculation result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than 1, 1 round must be spend preparing in order to use this action again. If the result is greater than 0 and less 0.5, your character must spend 2 rounds preparing. While preparing the [Off Guard](./CombatModifiersAndCombatAssists.md#off-guard-disadvantage) Combat Modifier is gained. If engaged during this time characters can still attempt to dodge while preparing.

#### Uses Per Round if character is using multiple loaded weapons

If characters have loaded weapons (for instance loaded muzzle loading firearms) within easy access to themselves, they can forgo loading, and use a faster Uses Per Round type that the Narrator decides. For instance, for muzzle loading pistols being drawn from a chest rig, "Swift" seems like a reasonable Uses Per Round type.

## Combat Speed

Different characters get different movement speeds in combat on a battlemap.

**Governing Skill:** The skill that governs this type of movement speed.

**Feet Per Governing Skill Dice:** The number of feet per dice of the governing skill dice pool. This includes dice modifications such as skill buff effects, carry weight penalties, injuries, etc. If the resulting number isn't a multiple of 5, round down to the nearest multiple of 5.

**Reflex Speed Attribute:** The Attribute that governs Reflex Speed.

**Feet Per Reflex Speed Attribute:** The number of feet per gained/lost per Reflex Speed Attribute.

### Reflex Speed

Characters with a higher Reflex Speed Attribute are quicker to plan and act in combat. While lower Reflex Speed Attribute characters are deciding what to do, high Reflex Speed Attribute characters are already in motion. For each positive/negative level in RFX, the character gains/loses movement speed.

RFX speed can be used to resolve circumstances when it is unclear which opponent moved first or closed some distance. RFX Speed is used first on a character's turn, with lower RFX characters considered to have not moved/acted yet. This rule takes inspiration from the gun vs knife debate at close distances, where it is argued that within a certain distance, a quick knife wielder might be able to close the distance before the shooter could get accurate shots on target. The ensuing ranged versus melee combat rolls would be disadvantageous for the ranged combatant as they are in melee reach.

#### Example 1

A rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an archer who is 10 feet away. The rogue has a 1 in RFX and the archer has a 0 in RFX. The archer declares he is going to shoot the rogue with his bow as he uses his movement speed to stay out of range of the knife. The rogue declares he is going to close the distance, attack with the knife, and stay on the archer, which will be disadvantageous for the archer since melee versus ranged combat in close quarters favors melee attacks. Since the Rogue has a higher reflex, he can move 10 feet with his RFX Speed before the archer can lose the arrow, closing the distance. Now they will make combat rolls versus one another, with the archer being at a clear disadvantage.

The archer, now likely wounded from the rogue knife, tries to use the rest of his movement speed to stay away from the rogue's knife range. However, the gap between the rogue and the archer is 0 feet as the rogue stays on the archer, assuming he has the same or greater remaining movement speed as the archer, ready to stab him again next round.

#### Example 2

A rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an archer who is 15 feet away. The rogue has a 1 in RFX and the archer has a 0 in RFX. The archer declares he is going to shoot the rogue with his bow as he uses his movement speed to stay out of range of the knife. The rogue declares he is going to close the distance and stab the archer, which will be disadvantageous for the archer since melee versus ranged combat in close quarters favors melee attacks. Since the Rogue has a higher reflex, he can move 10 feet with his RFX Speed before the archer can lose the arrow, not entirely able to close the gap. With 5 feet between the rogue and the archer, the arrow is shot. The Rogue must now try and dodge the arrow, before he can attack, possibly proving fatal.

The archer is then able to flee backward, keeping the 5 feet of distance between him and the rogue, never getting stabbed, assuming he has the same or greater remaining movement speed as the rogue.

#### Example 3

A crappy rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an archer who is 10 feet away. The rogue has a 0 in RFX and the archer has a 0 in RFX. The archer declares he is going to shoot the rogue with his bow as he uses his movement speed to stay out of range of the knife. The rogue declares he is going to close the distance and stab the archer, which will be disadvantageous for the archer since melee versus ranged combat in close quarters favors melee attacks. Since the rogue has the same RFX as the archer, he is slow to get into motion, which gives the archer time to lose his arrow as he also begins moving. The Rogue must now try and dodge the arrow, possibly proving fatal.

The archer is then able to flee backward as the rogue chases, keeping the 10 feet of distance between him and the rogue, never getting stabbed, assuming he has the same or greater remaining movement speed as the rogue.

#### Example 4

A rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on a knight who is 10 feet away. The rogue has 1 RFX and the knight has 0 RFX. The knight declares he is going to move forward and swing on the rogue with the longsword he has in his hands. The rogue declares he is going to close the distance and stab the knight. Since the Rogue has a higher reflex, he can move 10 feet with his RFX Speed before the knight can move, closing the gap. Since the knight already had his sword ready to go, combat rolls are made versus one another.

### Using multiple Combat Speeds on the same round

Whenever a character needs to use multiple movement speeds in a round, calculate what percentage of their movement they've used that round for their initial movement, with the remainder percent being used for another movement speed, rounded down to the next multiple of 5.

For example, if a character has 30 feet of "Terrestrial Combat Speed" and 15 feet of "Climb Combat Speed". The character walks 15 feet up to a climbable rock face. They've used 50% (15/30 = 0.5) of their movement speed, leaving them 50% of their climb combat speed. 50% of 15 feet is 7.5 feet, which we round down to the nearest multiple of 5 which is 5 feet. Therefore the character can climb 5 feet up the rock face.

### Difficult Terrain

Steep mountains, ice-covered ground, swamps, etc. are difficult terrain. It takes twice the movement to move through these terrains.

### Mounted Combat Speed

When riding a mount in combat:

- The rider's Dexterity core Skill or Riding Vocational Skill level is used in place of the mount's governing skill level for determining the governing skill dice pool size, capped by the mount's governing skill level.
- The rider's RFX level is used in place of the mount's RFX, capped by the mount's RFX level.

Additionally, when a mounted character or their mount takes an injury in combat, an Dexterity or Riding check equivalent to the injury level must be succeeded to stay on horseback, or else they are knocked off.

## Ammunitions

### Ammo Type

Ammo Type determines the resource a weapon uses to operate.

### Dice Pool Mod

Represent either an addition or subtraction of dice to the Combat Roll Dice Pool in which this Ammo is being used. This is to represent ammunition types that warrant a change effectiveness. For instance, a bomb arrow is significantly more dangerous than a Standard Light Arrow, so it would receive additional dice. However, a blunted practice arrow (such as the comical boxing glove arrow) is significantly less dangerous than a Standard Light Arrow, so it would lose dice.

### Base Dice Tier Adjustment

Alters a combat rolls base dice tier. For instance, if a Mundane Light Bow (Level 0, or as dice 3d6) were to use a Survival Light Arrow which has a -1 Base Dice Tier Adjustment, then the resulting combat roll would use 1d4,2d6 base dice tier (Level -1). If instead a Standard Light Arrow were used, the resulting combat roll would use 3d6 base dice tier (Level 0).

### Penetration

Additional Penetration from the Ammo. Ammo Penetration is added to Weapon Penetration results in the total Penetration for the Combat Roll.

### Range

Ammo can have a Range that overrides the Weapon's Range that it is used with. This can represent self propelled made projectiles or high pressure ballistic ammunition. If a Ammo Range is "None", then default to the Weapon's Range.

### Damage Types

Damage Types inflicted by the Ammo.

### Area Of Effect

Ammo can have an Area Of Effect that overrides the Weapon's Area Of Effect that it is used with. This can represent a bomb arrow or an explosive projectile. If a Ammo Area Of Effect is "None", then default to the Weapon's Area Of Effect.

## Weapons

Examples of weapons include swords, bows, guns, or even a character's fists.

In order to make a combat roll, a character needs to specify what weapon they will be using. Weapons can dramatically improve the chances of getting more wins on a combat roll, make it possible to engage opponents at far distances, enable rapid engagement of multiple opponents, deal various types of damages which an opponents might be weak to, etc...

Below is a key to help you understand the weapon tables below.

### Name

The name of a weapon is it's Weapon Type, followed by it's Handed Variation in parentheses, followed by it's Base Dice Tier Adjustment amount in parentheses.

For example, let's say we are making rapier sword for use in our game. Rapier's logically seem to be Medium Melee weapons. In regards which Handed Variations it gets, most rapier grips only include space for one hand, thus we only use the One-handed and Dual-wielded, and not Two-handed. Next, in regards to the Base Dice Tier Adjustment amounts, we note that rapiers were designed to favor the piercing rather than slashing. Thus, we could give a +2 Base Dice Tier Adjustment Amount when piercing with this sword.

Thus, our rapier would have the below weapons:

"Medium Pierce Melee (One-handed) (+2), Medium Pierce Melee (Dual-wielded) (+2), Medium Slash Melee (One-handed) (+0), Medium Slash Melee (Dual-wielded) (+0)"

### Weapon Type

Just describes what type of weapon.

### Base Dice Tier Adjustment

Adjusts the [Base Dice Tier](./../GeneralRules/BaseDiceTiers.md) by the amount specified. This generally is used to indicate the quality of the weapon in question. For instance a "Hand Crossbow (One-handed) (+1)" will have 1d8,2d6 as it's Base Dice. The table below only shows the +0 Base Dice Tier Adjustment amount for the sake of brevity.

### Handed Variation

#### One-handed

The dice pool modifier added when wielding a weapon in one hand or equivalent appendage. This frees up the other hand to hold a shield, another weapon, an important item, etc...

#### Two-handed

The dice pool modifier added when wielding a weapon in two hands or equivalent appendages.

#### Dual-wielded

The dice pool modifier added when dual wielding a main weapon in one hand with an off-handed weapon in the other hand. Only weapons with the "Dual-wielded" handed variation are eligible for dual wielding. To dual wield, a character must have at least one skill point in both of the weapons held.

### Dice Pool Mod

Represents the dice pool modification that a particular weapon gives you. The better the weapon is as a force multiplier, the larger the dice pool modification.

### Penetration

The amount of Penetration a weapon adds to a characters combat roll. See [Penetration](./Defense.md#penetration) for more details.

### Range

The distance at which a weapon can be used. See [Range](./Range.md) for more details.

### Uses Per Round

The amount of times a weapon be used per round. See [Uses Per Round](./UsesPerRound.md) for more details.

### Area Of Effect

The shape and amount of area a weapon attack creates. See [Area Of Effect](./AreaOfEffect.md) for more details.

### Ammo Type And Ammo Per Use

The ammo type required to use the weapon and the amount of ammo consumed per use of the weapon. See [Ammo Type](./Ammunitions.md#ammo-type) for more details.

### Damage Types

The types of Damage a weapon inflicts when dealing injuries.

## Weapon Combat Skills

A Weapon Combat Skill covers the use of a group of similar weapons. The tables over on the [Weapons](./Weapons.md) page show which weapons are group under which Weapon Combat Skills. For instance, the "Medium Melee" Weapon Combat Skill covers the use of "Medium Hafted", "Medium Sword", and "Medium Spear".

All Weapon Combat Skills have the governing attributes of STR, RFX, and INT. This is to reflect that the stronger, faster, and smarter a character is, the more lethal they are in combat regardless of the weapon. A STR character hits harder, is tougher, and is more conditioned for combat. A RFX character hits faster and is harder to pin down. An INT character hits smarter and uses tactics. It is the player's/narrator's job to flavor their attacks to reflect how they are leveraging their innate attributes as they fight.

### Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

There is obviously overlap certain Weapon Combat Skills. For melee Weapon Combat Skills, weapon reach, footwork, and the biomechanics of swinging a weapon have some overlap. For ranged Weapon Combat Skills, having a proper base, judging the distance, leading your targets, aiming and releasing the projectile smoothly are examples of the overlap. Narrators should allow a character to gain Weapon Combat Skills, though of a lesser level, in similar Weapon Combat Skills in regards to size and function. This not only allows characters to experiment with new weapons but also makes narrative sense.

Starting with the weapon skill your character currently possesses, each horizontal (right and left on the table) or vertical (up and down on the table) jump is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. When moving horizontally within a Size type, you may loop around the other side of the table as if it were right beside it. You cannot go below 0 on a combat skill for either melee or ranged weapons via the table below.

#### Melee Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

|   Weapons   |
| :----------: |
| Close Melee |
| Medium Melee |
| Large Melee |
| Reach Melee |

#### Bow/Crossbow Weapon Skill Transfer

| Size/Type |   Bows   |   Crossbows   |
| :-------: | :-------: | :------------: |
|   Hand   |          | Hand Crossbow |
|   Light   | Light Bow | Light Crossbow |
|   Heavy   | Heavy Bow | Heavy Crossbow |

#### Guns

|   Weapons   |
| :---------: |
| Small Guns |
| Medium Guns |
| Heavy Guns |

#### Respecing Combat Skills

Since certain weapon sizes provide more combat skill transfer than others, it is intend for the narrator to allow rebalancing skill point investments as to not waste skill levels as long as all previously know skills maintain they're skill level.

For example, a character has just been given 1 skill point to spend and has a level 3 in Small Blade. They wish to invest their skill point into the Medium Sword skill to try a new magic sword they found. Since they have a 3 in Small Blade already, by the Weapon Combat Skill Transfer rules they have a level 2 in Medium Sword. If they were to invest their skill point into Medium Sword to bring it to level 3, they are technically wasting skill points as had they from the start only invested the 3 skill points from Small Blade into Medium sword, with the addition of the unspent skill point, they'd have a level 4 in Medium sword, which would also give them a level 3 in Small Blade. Instead of wasting skill points, they can take the 3 skill points from Small Blade and the 1 unspent skill point and spend it on bring Medium sword to level 4. Since having a level 4 in Medium Sword gives a level 3 in Small Blade, nothing has changed in Small Blade.

## Combat Roll

Combat rolls are Dice Pools that represent a character's effectiveness in combat, generally with a specific weapon.

- +Base Dice (varies with Base Dice Tier, defaults to 3d6)
- +/- 1d6 per Weapon Skill
- +/- 1d6 per STR, RFX, or INT if Governing Attribute of Combat Skill
- +/- Weapon Dice Pool Mods (Hand Crossbow, Medium Spear, etc...)
- +/- Ammo Dice Pool Mods (Arrow, Bomb Arrow, etc...)

### Example 1:

Javk Wick the rogue has a Medium Pierce Melee (+0) (One-handed), Medium Pierce Melee (+0) (Dual-wielded) dual-wielded with a dagger. He has level 2 in Medium Sword and level 1 in Small Blade. He has Level 1 RFX.

- +3d6 (Base Dice)
- +2d6 (Level 2 Medium Sword Skill)
- +1d6 (Level 1 RFX)
- +1d6 (Medium Pierce Melee (+0) (One-handed), Medium Pierce Melee (+0) (Dual-wielded) One Handed)
- +1d6 (Dagger Dual-Wielded)

Based on the dice above, Javk uses his sword and dagger for thrusting rolls 8d6.

### Example 2:

Javk Wick the rogue has a Light Crossbow and Standard Light Bolts. He has a weapon skill of level 1 with the Crossbow Skill. He has level 1 in RFX.

- +3d6 (Base Dice)
- +1d6 (Level 1 Crossbow Skill)
- +1d6 (Level 1 RFX)
- +2d6 (Light Crossbow Two-Handed)
- +0d6 (Standard Light Bolt)

Based on the dice above, Javk using his Light Crossbow has a 7d6.

## Dodge Roll

When a combat roll is made against a character who is not capable of making an opposing combat roll, the defender can make an Dexterity Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. This is an assumed reflexive action, IE a character could have, as part of the Declaration Phase, declared"... and I'll try to dodge anything being shot at me" every round. Any levels over the defender's Dodge Roll wins count as victories for the attacker. The only victory level outcome a Dodge can achieve is exiting a grapple. A Combat Roll and Dodge Roll can both be made in a round.

## Combat Rounds

Combat is run in a Round-by-round format. Each character can perform 1 combat roll within a round (though additional things like climbing as part of your movement or reactively dodging arrows are expected) with liberties regarding the narrative flow of the game. For instance, it doesn't take an action to shout out something to another character while fighting a monster, though it would take a round to explain something complicated.

Actions in combat rounds are not solely movements and attacks. A combat action can be anything a person could do within a few seconds, such as turning over a table with their weapon, swinging from a chandelier, or dropping a boulder onto an enemy. The Narrative flow you develop while playing will guide you in what the players can do in the game, and how long it will take to do it.

### Round Order

Every action within Round-by-Round conflicts happens almost at the same time or in direct succession to one another. This means that one character's action is NOT explicitly followed by another character's action. It should be considered as everything happening together, with the one exception being RFX speed.

To make sense of this potential 'chaos', there is a declaration phase and an action phase.

#### Declaration Phase

The character with the lowest RFX declares what they are doing first. That might seem odd as you could think characters with higher RFX should get to move first, but this is the declaration phase, no one is moving yet. If two Characters have the same RFX, they each roll a D6 (though D20s work better), where the highest resulting roll gets to declare later for the rest of the combat encounter.

Players who declare LATER hold the upper hand in combat.

Once a player has declared what they are going to perform, they cannot change their mind. They are locked into performing that action in this round. The players who declare after another can choose an action that counters or complements the declared action of another character.

This means that characters with the highest RFX can see and react to what their opponents are going to do.

#### Action Phase

Once all characters have declared their actions, the order is reversed starting with the person with the highest RFX acting first. Though things mostly happen simultaneously within the round, it's sometimes important to know which blade landed before another, or who managed to perform their action a little bit faster than another. In these situations, characters with a higher reflex will always win.

At the beginning of the Action Phase, all players can roll their dice pools for the actions they expect to take that round, such as combat rolls. This is to help things combat move efficiently.

### Keep your Combat Rolls for the round

Combat Rolls made with them should be held onto during combat after they've been rolled. This is to remember your current victory levels for the round. This is also in case your character loses dice due to injury or they gain Disadvantage/Advantage in that round, which will affect the already rolled dice pool.

#### Removing Dice to an already rolled Dice Pool

Whenever losing dice of the same kind, always remove dice from left to right. This is to leave it up to chance if the dice they lost that round punish or are indifferent to their wins for that round. With physical dice, you can just roughly straighten out the dice and begin removing in that order.

#### Applying Disadvantage/Advantage to an already rolled Combat Roll Dice Pools

If your character gains disadvantage (often the result of a stagger or being knocked prone) or advantage (you engage a prone opponent as your second target with a melee weapon) after you've already rolled a Combat Roll dice pool that round, you will retroactively apply said disadvantage/advantage to your those dice pools. This could turn some dice that were wins into fails and vice versa.

* Automatically fail any check that requires moving their body (i.e. Dexterity, Athletics,  etc... )
* Serious Resistance to all damage.
* Complete Resistance to poison, necrotic, and disease, although a poison, rot, or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

### Prone

- Only able to crawl using their Climb Combat Speed.
- Disadvantage on any check that generally assumes a character is standing (i.e. Combat Rolls, Dexterity Checks, etc... )
- Melee Combat Rolls (Melee or Reach Ranges) made by a standing character against a prone character have the [High Ground](./CombatModifiersAndCombatAssists.md#high-ground-advantage) combat modifier (Advantage).
- Ranged attacks against a prone opponent gain Disadvantage if the Narrator believes they would be a more difficult target due to being a smaller target. For instance, shooting a prone opponent 10 feet away wouldn't have Disadvantage. However, shooting a prone sniper at range who is making themselves a small target would incure Disadvantage.

### Restrained

- Can't move.
- Disadvantage on any checks that require coordinated movement (i.e. Combat Rolls, Dexterity, Athletics,  etc... )

### Stunned

* Incapacitated (see the condition).
* Can't coherently speak.
* Automatically fail any check that requires coordinated movement (i.e. Combat Rolls, Dexterity, Athletics,  etc... )

### Unconscious

- Incapacitated (see the condition).
- Can't speak.
- Unaware of surroundings.
- The character drops whatever they are holding and falls prone (see the condition).
- Automatically fail any check that requires coordinated movement (i.e. Dexterity, Athletics,  etc... )

## Injury and Healing

### Injury

Injury is handled as part of the narrative with dice penalties being applied per injury to all a character's dice checks. A character is rendered [Incapacitated](./Conditions.md#incapacitated) once they've taken a summed 5 or above injury dice.

Typical "status effects" such as being poisoned, frostbitten, bleeding, madness, etc... are handled elegantly through the injury system. For instance, if you were dealt a Serious injury by mild poison mist, then narratively explain it as getting a large breath full. If the character instead was dealt a Serious injury by an extremely lethal poison mist, then narratively it would be explained as only getting a small whiff. The resulting dice penalty acts as your "status effect" debuffing your character until they are resolved. For instance, anti-venom might be able to remove the poison injury or warming up by a fire might reduce hypothermia from the cold.

### Healing

Since Injuries work on a narrative severity scale, so does the healing that can be performed. These could come from Magic or science-based medicine.

## Victory Levels

- Victory Levels from Physical or Bodily damage can be reduced equal to the amount of STR a character has per combat encounter. If STR is negative, the level of Victory increases by 1.
- Victory levels from Mental or Soul damage can be reduced equal to the amount of INT a character has per combat encounter. If INT is negative, the level of Victory increases by 1.
- Any combination of lower Victory Level outcomes is possible as long as they sum up to be less than or equal to the Victory Level achieved. For instance, with a Level 2 victory, a character could perform both a Stagger and a Minor Injury against there opponent.
- It is mandatory that for a character to deal any Victory Level outcome, whomever control's said character must describe in awesome detail how they are preforming said Victory Level outcome. Creativity is encouraged!

### Level 1 victory

#### Minor Injury

-1d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools. Will naturally heal over the next few days, or faster if treated actively.

#### Stagger

The opponent gains the [Staggered](./Conditions.md#staggered) condition until the end of the next round.

This could be sand thrown in a character's face, being shoulder-checked, or losing their footing.

#### Shove

The opponent is shoved in the desired direction.

The character can either roll a Lift check or take the average amount of Wins rounded down. If a character is using magic, they may use a Magic Skill instead of Lift, assuming the magic could shove someone. For each win achieved, a character can shove another character 5 feet in a straight line. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance. For each size category, the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. The Narrator can change this distance based on unusual circumstances (i.e. humanoid-sized creature weighs as much as a Large sized creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).

#### Grapple

Enter/exit a Grapple. If entering into a Grapple, apply the [Grappled](./Conditions.md#grappled) condition to both you and your opponent. Exiting a Grapple can also be accomplished with a Dodge roll.

#### Grapple Move

While in a grapple, you can move your opponent.

The character can either roll a Lift check or take the average amount of wins rounded down. If a character is using magic, they may use a Magic Skill instead of Lift, assuming the magic could grapple someone. For each win achieved, a character can Move another character 10 feet. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance. For each Size the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. If your character is required to move during the move, you can not exceed your normal amount of movement for that round. The Narrator can change this distance based on unusual circumstances (i.e. humanoid-sized creature weighs as much as a Large sized creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).

### Level 2 victory

#### Medium Injury

-2d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools. Must be treated relatively soon otherwise further penalties may apply such as infection.

#### Disarm

The opponent loses their weapon. If an opponent is dual-wielding, they will only lose one of their weapons.

##### Grapple Disarm

Once already in a Grapple, as part of their declaration phase a character can declare they are attempting a Grapple Disarm to disarm their opponent. The character attempting the Grapple Disarm must be unarmed. They gain Advantage to Unarmed combats roll versus the armed grappled opponent. The armed opponent gains Disadvantage on their combat roll versus the character that is grappling them. The character attempting the Grapple Disarm may only take the Disarm Level 2 Victory (this means they cannot delegate their attack to inflict an injury or execute a trip regardless of how high the victory achieved.)

### Level 3 victory

#### Serious Injury

-3d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools.  The character will die in time if the wound is untreated.

#### Trip

The opponent gains the [Prone](./Conditions.md#prone) condition.

A character can declare they are attempting to get up on a round they start prone. Getting up requires the downed opponent to use their entire movement speed. They can regain their footing and remove the Prone condition at the end of the round they were getting up.

Instead of getting up, a character can remain prone and crawl. They use their Climb Combat Speed to crawl instead of their movement speed.

### Level 4 Victory

#### Fatal Injury

-4d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools. Gains the [Incapacitated](./Conditions.md#incapacitated) condition and will die very soon if untreated.

#### Dismember

Remove an arm or leg, which also gives a Serious Injury to the opponent. Not available to ranged combat rolls unless there is a narrative explanation of how a ranged attack could dismember (magic, explosive projectiles, etc...).

#### Render Unconscious

Opponent gains the [Unconscious](./Conditions.md#unconscious) condition such as from head trauma, blood chokes, etc. Opponent receives a Medium Injury.

### Level 5 victory and higher

#### Death Blow

-5d to STR/RFX/INT governed Dice Pools. Instantly killed.

## Weakness and Resistance

### Weakness

Characters can be susceptible to certain sources of damage.

|              Name              |                        Effect                        | Duration | Source |
| :-----------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :------: | :----: |
|  Minor Weakness: (Damage Type)  | +1 to the level of injury received from damage type. |          |        |
| Medium Weakness: (Damage Type) | +2 to the level of injury received from damage type. |          |        |
| Serious Weakness: (Damage Type) | +3 to the level of injury received from damage type. |          |        |
|  Fatal Weakness: (Damage Type)  | +4 to the level of injury received from damage type. |          |        |

### Resistance

Characters can be resistant to certain sources of damage.

|                Name                |                      Effect                      | Duration | Source |
| :--------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: | :------: | :----: |
|  Minor Resistance: (Damage Type)  | -1 to victory levels received from damage type. |          |        |
|  Medium Resistance: (Damage Type)  | -2 to victory levels received from damage type. |          |        |
| Serious Resistance: (Damage Type) | -3 to victory levels received from damage type. |          |        |
|  Fatal Resistance: (Damage Type)  | -4 to victory levels received from damage type. |          |        |
| Complete Resistance: (Damage Type) | Negate victory levels received from damage type. |          |        |

## Combat Modifiers

Combat Modifiers represent different circumstances and actions that can occur within combat.

### Defensive (Advantage) (No Victory Level Outcomes)

A character purely focuses on defending themselves.

No victory level outcomes can be achieved for the round by the defender. Effects both to Combat Rolls and Dodge Rolls if declared. Is not applicable if Character can't solely focus on defending themselves, such as when they have Disadvantage to their Combat Rolls or Dodge Rolls. Examples include being Staggered, being attacked from outside a Grapple, getting up from being Prone, being Off Guard, Dashing, etc...

### Dash (2x Movement Speed)

Instead of engaging in a combat roll, a player can choose to focus purely on their movement in combat, doubling their movement speed. They can still Dodge.

### Ranged vs Melee (Disadvantage)

When a character is making a ranged attack, they gain Disadvantage on their ranged combat roll if they are within range of an opponent who is targeting them with a melee combat roll during that round.

### Stationary Shooting (Advantage) (Disadvantage to Dodge Rolls)

Remain stationary for an entire round to gain a more stable base for ranged attacks. Advantage on all of ranged attacks for that round, except against opponents engaging the character with a Melee or Reach Range combat roll. Due to being a stationary target, Disadvantage on Dodge Roll.

### High ground (Advantage)

Bonus received through achieving a height advantage against an opponent, IE standing on a table, riding on a mount, or attacking an prone opponent with a melee weapon. High ground for ranged attacks, must have a more significant height differential than for melee attacks, such as shooting from a climbed tree or atop a castle wall.

### Off Guard (Disadvantage)

Penalty to combat rolls and dodge rolls received when a character is actively engaged in something else, IE picking a lock, hacking a terminal, being distracted, etc.

### Sneak Attack (CL in lieu of defense roll)

An attack made while hidden that can't be defended against by the opponent. Usually proceeded by a Stealth Skill Check versus a Perception Skill Check. The Narrator will assign a CL for the attack. As an example, slitting someone's throat with a dagger is a CL 1, however, doing the same with a great sword would be far more difficult. Any wins achieved over the CL count towards the level of victory. Failing the CL or not fully incapacitating the opponent commences the next round of combat, where the opponent is then engaged.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

#### Half Cover: Minor Resistance

A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

#### Three-quarters Cover: Serious Resistance

A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

#### Full Cover: Complete Resistance

A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

## Combat Assists

These are examples of [Assists](./../GeneralRules/Assists.md) that can be used in combat.

### Focused Shot (Advantage)

Usually achieved with the Perception Core Skill.

While making a ranged attack, focus on a single opponent and target a weak point. Your Uses Per Round is reduced to 1 for the turn.

### Charge (Advantage) (Disadvantage to Dodge Rolls)

Usually achieved with the Athletics Core Skill.

If there is 10 ft between the character and an opponent, they may add their momentum to their melee attack. The character charging must move in a straight line, and once a charge is initiated as a portion of a character's movement, their directions must remain constant the entire round. Disadvantage to Dodging while charging.

### Brace (Advantage versus Charge) (Disadvantage to Dodge Rolls)

Usually achieved with the Lift Core Skill.

A brace is a move purely to counter a charge. Character gains Advantage versus charging opponents and charging opponents lose their Advantage versus them. No movement can be used while bracing. Bracing uses the opponent's momentum against them, enabling a prepared defender to more easily stagger, trip or injure the charging opponent.

### Pack Tactics

Usually achieved by two or more characters with a Teamwork Vocation (Like Pack Hunter or Soldier) or the Communication Core Skill.

When two or more attackers make a combat roll against the same opponent with at least one of them within 5 feet, they can make this collabrative assist roll. If successful, they can coordinate their attacks, gaining Advantage on their attack rolls.

### Formation

Usually achieved with a "Soldier" Vocation Assist or the Communication Core Skill.

When two ore more allies are next to eachother, they can make a collabrative assist roll. If the assist is successful, then all characters within the formation gain Advantage to their Melee or Reach range combat rolls.

# Advanced Rules

## Equipment, Carry Weight, and Weight Classes

### Equipment

Represent items a character has on their person in an easy-to-reach placement or that are being worn. This generally covers things needed in combat such as weapons, armor, quivers/arrows, potions, etc...

### Carry Weight

Carry Weight represents a character's ability to carry heavier equipment while still being able to move semi-normally depending on weight class.

For each dice in a character's Lift dice pool the character gains 50 lbs of Carry Weight. Any dice penalty on the Lift dice pool from the characters Weight Class is disregarded for this calculation.

|       Name       | Desc |   Duration   |               Source               |
| :--------------: | :--: | :-----------: | :--------------------------------: |
| Equipment Weight | 0 lb | While Equiped |             Equipment             |
|   Carry Weight   | ? lb |   Indefinte   | +50 lbs Carry Weight per Lift dice |

### Weight Classes

Effects that represent the physical strain of carrying equipment. Some characters will purposefully be in a higher weight class to gain the benefits of heavier armor and weapons, making up for their Carry weight penalty with better gear.

|            Name            |                Desc                |  Duration  |                     Source                     |
| :------------------------: | :--------------------------------: | :--------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
|    Weight Class: Light    | -0d to STR/RFX governed Dice Pools | Indefinite | 0% =< Equipment Weight <= 25% of Carry Weight |
|    Weight Class: Medium    | -1d to STR/RFX governed Dice Pools | Indefinite | 25% < Equipment Weight <= 50% of Carry Weight |
|    Weight Class: Heavy    | -2d to STR/RFX governed Dice Pools | Indefinite | 50% < Equipment Weight <= 100% of Carry Weight |
| Weight Class: Overburdened | -4d to STR/RFX governed Dice Pools | Indefinite |    100% < Equipment Weight of Carry Weight    |

## Vision and Light

The ability of a character to see is crucial for various tasks. These tasks include identifying threats, locating hidden items, attacking enemies, and directing spells, among others. A character's visibility can be significantly impaired by darkness or any other factors that obscure vision.

### Vision Obscurement

There are different levels of obscurity that a given area can have, ranging from light to heavy.

#### Unobscured

An area is considered unobscured if it does not impede a character's vision. In such areas, characters roll normal Perception checks that rely on sight.

#### Lightly Obscured

An area is considered lightly obscured if it has dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage. In such areas, creatures face a Disadvantage to Perception checks that rely on sight.

#### Heavily Obscured

An area is heavily obscured when it has darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage. In these areas, vision is entirely blocked. Any creature trying to see something in a heavily obscured area is effectively blinded.

### Light

The illumination of an environment is categorized into three types: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

#### Bright Light (Unobscured)

Most creatures, including humans, can see normally in bright light. This light can come from various sources such as torches, lanterns, fires, or even gloomy days, and it illuminates within a specific radius.

#### Dim Light (Lightly Obscured)

Also referred to as shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. This area is typically a boundary between a source of bright light, like a torch, and the surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn, or even a particularly brilliant full moon, also counts as dim light.

#### Darkness (Heavily Obscured)

Darkness, on the other hand, creates a heavily obscured area. Characters encounter darkness outdoors at night (excluding moonlight nights), inside an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.

### Vision Types

#### Darkvision

A special ability that many creatures in fantasy realms, particularly those that live underground, possess. This ability allows a creature to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and see in darkness as if it were dim light up to a certain distance. However, the trade-off is that they can't distinguish colors in the dark, only different shades of gray.

#### Blindsight

Blindsight allows a creature to perceive its environment without the need for sight, within a certain range. It's typically found in creatures that lack eyes, such as oozes, or in those that have heightened senses or use echolocation, like bats and true dragons. These creatures can sense their surroundings regardless of visual obstructions or conditions.

#### Truesight

Within a designated range can see in regular and magical darkness, observe invisible entities and objects, effortlessly discern visual illusions, succeed on skill checks against them, and discern the true form of a shapechanger or a creature altered by magic. Additionally, can be used to see into the Ethereal Plane.

## Containers

Pouches, satchel, sacks, backpacks, chest, etc... are all consider containers. Each container can hold a certain amount of weight and/or volume within.

### Container Types

|       Name       | Weight Capacity (lbs) | Volume (ft^3) |  Examples Items  |
| :--------------: | :-------------------: | :-----------: | :--------------: |
| 300 lb container |          300          |      12      |      Chest      |
| 50 lb container |          50          |      1.6      |   Saddle Bags   |
| 35 lb container |          35          |      1.2      | Quality Backpack |
| 30 lb container |          30          |       1       |     Backpack     |
| 12 lb container |          12          |      0.4      |     Satchel     |
|  6 lb container  |           6           |      0.2      |      Pouch      |

### Containers in Combat

Characters will often stash or drop containers during combat as to not be in a heavier Weight Class. This is perfectly acceptable, but it is within the Narrators right to treat these items as fair game to be swiped by the enemy if an opportunity arises, however this might effect their Weight Class as well. Character's wishing to avoid a having their loot stolen can keep it on their backs, by a mount to stash it on, increase their equipment weight, etc...

### Container Example from Fallen

When representing a container on a character sheet, a similar table as the one below is used. For Containers, whatever the first item in the list is marks it as what kind of container it is.

A containers type will be seen under the "#" or "quantity" header. This is because you can't have stacks of containers, only instances.

| Name                    |       ##       |        Effect        |  LB  | Value | Description |
| ----------------------- | :-------------: | :------------------: | :--: | :---: | ----------- |
| Backpack                | 30 lb container |                      |  5  | 2 bc |             |
| Light Longbow           |        1        |      Light Bow      |  2  | 25 bc |             |
| Quiver (capacity: 20)   |        1        |                      |  1  | 1 bc |             |
| Light Arrow - Broadhead |       20       | Standard Light Arrow | 0.05 | 5 cc |             |
| Ring, Mundane           |        1        |                      | 0.2 | 30 cc |             |
| Copper Coin             |       70       |                      | 0.02 | 1 cc |             |

## Effects

Effects can be applied to either characters or items, adding buffs/debuffs, weapons, defenses, narrative considerations, injuries, status effects, etc... In a fantasy setting, these could be magical enchantments. In a modern setting, these could be attachments to a rifle.

If you have two different effects active that buff or debuff some feature of your character, these do not stack unless otherwise stated.

The two large categories are "Character Sheet Effects" and "Narrative Effects".

### Character Sheet Effects

"Character Sheet Effects" can essentially be thought of as effects that change something on your character sheet. For instance, if a character gains a Weapon, then they would also gain a new combat roll. If a character gained an Injury, then they'd have to recalculate many of there dice pools with the penalties from the Injuries.

#### Attribute Dice Mod

Adds or subtracts dice for dice pools if they governed by at least one of the Attributes specified.

- [Injury](./../CombatRules/InjuryAndHealing.md#injury)
- [Weight Classes](./../AdvancedRules/EquipmentCarryWeightAndWeightClasses.md#weight-classes)

#### Attribute Level Adjustment

For a specified Attribute, a Character receives an adjustment to it's level. The resulting level can not go outside the upper and lower bounds for a Attribute.

| Name         | Desc             | Duration   | Source |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Enhanced STR | +1 to STR level. | Indefinite |        |

#### Defense

See [Defense](./src/CoreRules/CombatRules/Defense.md) for more information.

#### Set Attribute Level

Sets a specified Attribute of a character to a new value. If the character's innate Attribute is greater than or equal to the new value, no change occurs.

| Name           | Effect                   | Duration   | Source |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Super Strength | Strength set to level 4. | Indefinite |        |
| Super Reflex   | Reflex set to level 4.   | Indefinite |        |

#### Set Skill Level

| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Super Perception | Perception set to level 5. | Indefinite |        |

#### Skill Base Dice Tier

Sets the base dice of specific skills or vocations dice pools.

For instance, if a Mundane Fire Magic Spellcasting Focus is used, all uses of the Fire Magic Skill have 3d6. With a Excellent Fire Magic Spellcasting Focus, all uses of the Fire magic Skill have 3d8 instead. Base Dice Tiers also apply to tools/gear used in skill rolls (high-quality climbing equipment for use with Athletics), and is meant to apply both in and out of combat.

#### Weapons

#### Ammunitions

See [Ammunitions](./src/CoreRules/CombatRules/Ammunitions.md) for more information.

### Narrative Effects

"Narrative Effects" can essentially be thought of as effects that do not change anything on a character sheet when added.

For instance, a Size Effect doesn't change anything else on your sheet when added, though it could have a massive impact on how a character is played. A potion with a Healing Effect doesn't have any mechanical effect until a player uses it within narrative.
