# Introduction

## Welcome to Fogent Roleplay

Welcome to Fogent Roleplay.

Fogent Roleplay is a setting agnostic TTRPG (Table Top Roleplay Game) that is intended to remove the unneeded complexity common in many TTRPGs while not sacrificing emergent/tactical gameplay. If you love the simplicity, flexibility, and narrative focus of Cogent Roleplay, but love tactical battle map combat, magic items, campaign progression, and sweet loot, then you are in the right place.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then D&D:

- **Setting Agnostic:** Unlike most TTRPGs, Fogent Roleplay and it's rules aren't tied any setting. It is designed from the ground up to easily run games in existing settings or in brand-new ones you create. This way, your group can learn one easy-to-use system to play in various settings such as medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, galactic warfare, survival horror, etc... This makes Fogent Roleplay great for world builders and authors looking to collaboratively create/reveal their worlds.
- **Elegant and Intuitive Rules:** While other TTRPGs require multiple books worth of rules to play, by contrast, Fogent Roleplay has ~40 pages of core rules, much of which consist of examples. This makes Fogent Roleplay extremely easy for new Players/Narrators to pick up.
- **Narrative Focused:** Most TTRPGs feel very different in and out of combat, with non-combat roleplay having great narrative flow where your character can attempt almost anything, but once combat is entered it feels more like a video game where characters can only perform the exact actions as described in the rules. Fogent Roleplay elegantly handles combat within the narrative flow while still having balanced/tactical combat. Combat in Fogent Roleplay feels more like an awesome fight scene in a movie, rather than video game characters just trying to get each other to 0 HP.
- **Offloading Complexity to the Narrative:** The rules are purposefully built to offload as much complexity to the narrative as possible. Instead of every rule complexity/edge case turing into a legal battle between the players and narrator, it just becomes a discussion about what would narratively make sense. Therefore, what is best for your character mechanically, what logically makes sense in the context of the setting, and what is most narratively satisfying are the same thing in Fogent Roleplay!
- **Making the Narrator's Job Easy:** Fogent Roleplay is neither designed to nor intends to have a rule for every minute situation. Instead, we want to give the Narrator a multi-tool of powerful, flexible, and intuitive rules. We want a Narrator's pre-game prep to primarily consist of creating insane plot twists, designing cool combat encounters, crafting awesome magic items, figuring out how a player character's backstory ties into the story, ect... rather than spending hours understanding rules.

What makes Fogent Roleplay different then Cogent Roleplay:

* **Innovation:** Whether it be rebalanced Core Skills, reworked Vocations, rebalanced weapons, an Advantage/Disadvantage system, rebalanced destiny point rules, automated character sheet support, etc... Fogent Roleplay has taken the best ideas of Cogent Roleplay to their logical conclusions while embracing innovation.
* **Tactical Battlemap Combat:** Fogent Roleplay has rules to be run on a battlemap. This allows for awesome tactical fight scenes where a character's positioning and surrounding environment factor into combat. While Fogent Roleplay can be run in the theater of the mind, it works even better on a battlemap.
* **Mature Ruleset:** Fogent Roleplay provides a mature and robust ruleset with no mechanical edge cases (if you can find one, please let us know). Not only were the rules battle-tested via 100+ sessions durning it's development, most of the rules have been converted into code equivalent logic. Since the resulting software works, the rules are mechanically robust.
* **Dice Pool Scaling:** Fogent Roleplay wants players to feel like ever small improvement has a tangible impact. To this end, whenever possible we scale off the size of dice pools of the various skills a character has for just about everything. If your character has a big Athletics dice pool, they are really fast both in and out of combat. Did you just improve your magic skill, we'll now all your lower level spells just got slightly increased range, area of effect, uses per round, ect...
* **Magic System Rules:** The Magic System Template allows for the easy creation of balanced magic systems regardless of the setting.
* **Pre-made Settings:** If you don't have the time to come up with an entire setting for your players to play in, Fogent Roleplay comes with pre-made campaign settings. This is an ongoing effort with more becoming available over time.

May your stories be epic,

# General Rules

## Dice Pool

A Dice Pool is a collection of one or more dice that when rolled determines how many "Wins" where achieved for whatever task was being attempted. D6 dice (otherwise known as six-sided dice) are the most common dice used, though D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20 are also used.

After the Dice Pool has been rolled, you sum up the amount of "Wins" from the roll. Any rolled dice that gets a 4 or greater counts as a win. D6 dice have a 50% chance of rolling a win, as 4, 5, and 6 on the dice are wins. D4s only have a 25% chance of a win, since only the 4 on the dice counts as a win. In general, the more dice and the more faces the dice have, the better the chances are of getting more wins.

| Dice Type | Probability of Win |
| :-------: | :----------------: |
|    D4    |        25%        |
|    D6    |        50%        |
|    D8    |       62.5%       |
|    D10    |        70%        |
|    D12    |        75%        |
|    D20    |        85%        |

All Dice Pools start with their "Base Dice", which by default are 3d6. You then add a D6 for each skill point, attribute point, or additional modifier that governs the Dice Pool.

Whenever you are removing dice from a dice pool (often done after taking an injury), always remove the lowest-sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.

## Challenge Level

Challenge Level represents the difficulty of a task set by the narrator proportionate to an **AVERAGE PERSON OF THE WORLD**. If a character is able to get enough wins to meet or beat the challenge level, they succeeded.

|      Difficulty      | Challenge Level |
| :------------------: | :-------------: |
|       Trivial       |      CL 0      |
|        Common        |      CL 1      |
|       Uncommon       |      CL 2      |
|     Specialized     |      CL 3      |
|      Difficult      |      CL 4      |
| Extremely Difficult |      CL 5      |
|     Unrealistic     |      CL 6      |
| Virtually Impossible |      CL 7      |
|    Inconceivable    |      CL 8      |
|      Legendary      |      CL 9      |

Pay attention the names of each Challenge Level. They are intended help Narrators and Players both intuitively understand how hard something should be within the narrative of the story.

For example, Javk Wick the Rogue hoist his unconscious injured ally onto his shoulders to get them both to safety. The Narrator determines that picking up someones limp body and getting them to your shoulders is neither a "Trivial" or "Common" thing for the average person to do. The Narrator sets the Challenge Level at "Uncommon" (CL 2) using the Lift Skill. If the ally was instead conscious, the Narrator might only set the Challenge Level to "Common" (CL 1) as hoisting an unconscious limp is far harder than a conscious compliant one.

## Attribute

An Attribute represent the innate characteristics of a character. An attribute can go from level -2 to level 5. Each level corresponds with a narrative significance.

| Attribute Level |                      Narrative Meaning                      |
| :-------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |            Painfully lacking in the attribute.            |
|       -1       |            Below an average person in our world.            |
|        0        |               An average person in our world.               |
|        1        |              Professional or naturally gifted.              |
|        2        | Elite or 'world-class'. Peak of real world human potential. |
|        3        |                Meta-human or genetic anomaly                |
|        4        |                        Demigod like                        |
|        5        |                Peak achievable or god like.                |

### Strength (STR)

Represents a character's innate muscle strength, bone density, tendon strength, physical durability, etc...

| Attribute Level |            Narrative Meaning            |
| :-------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|       -2       |                A squirrel                |
|       -1       |   Below an average person in our world   |
|        0        |      An average person in our world      |
|        1        |      Professional soldier or knight      |
|        2        | World's strongest man champion or Batman |
|        3        |     Bear, Ogre, or Captain America     |
|        4        |                 Hercules                 |
|        5        |                 Superman                 |

STR has the following effects:

- STR is factored into all STR Governed Skills (Athletics, Endurance, Lift, etc...). Greater STR can help a character move more in a combat round and carry heavier gear without being penalized.
- STR is a character's physical and bodily durability. In combat, for every point in STR a character can reduce a victory level achieved against them from physical (bludgeon, slash, pierce, etc...) or bodily (poisons, cold, etc...) damage types once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every point in STR a character can reduce a physical or bodily damage type injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of respite between each injury.

|        0        |          An average person in our world          |
|        1        | Professional thief, parkourist, or circus acrobat |
|        2        |    Gold medal gymnast or master martial artist    |
|        3        |                      Legolas                      |
|        4        |                     Spiderman                     |
|        5        |                The Flash or Hermes                |

RFX has the following effects:

- RFX is factored into all RFX Governed Skills (Dexterity, Perception, Stealth, etc...).
- As combat is conducted in a round-by-round format, the player with the highest RFX gets priority in that round.
- Character with higher RFX have better Reaction Movement Speed, which allows an amount of movement before slower characters within a combat round and increases all Movement Speeds.

### Intelligence (INT)

Represents a character's innate raw mental horsepower, IQ, consciousness, and mental/spiritual durability.

| Attribute Level |                           Narrative Meaning                           | Skill Points Gained/Lost Total |
| :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|       -2       |                               A zombie                               |               -3               |
|       -1       |                 Below an average person in our world                 |               -1               |
|        0        |                    An average person in our world                    |               0               |
|        1        |           University science professor or career politician           |               1               |
|        2        | Award-winning particle physicist or 'Sherlock Holmes' level detective |               3               |
|        3        |                              Tony Stark                              |               6               |
|        4        |                           Ultron or Skynet                           |               10               |
|        5        |                       Dr. Manhattan or Athena                       |               15               |

INT has the following effects:

- INT is factored into all INT Governed Skills (General Knowledge, Willpower, Communication, etc...).
- Starting at 0, for every INT point a player receives, they gain the same amount of additional skill points to spend. This effect is cumulative, refer to the "Skill Points Gained/Lost" to the total amount of skill points for a given INT level.
- INT is a measure of how durable a character's consciousness is to mental and spiritual attacks. In combat, for every point in INT a character can reduce a victory level achieved against them from spiritual or psychic damage types once every combat encounter. Outside of combat, for every point in INT a character can reduce a spiritual or psychic damage type injury against them as many times as they want, granted there is a couple minutes of respite between each injury.

### Why is there no Charisma Attribute

INT governs the "Communications" skill which is essentially your classical charisma stat. The reality is that being smarter makes you a better communicator. Verbal IQ is one of the components of an IQ test for a reason. And actually, one of the hallmarks of an intelligent creature is it's ability to communicate.

However, the beauty of Fogent Roleplay is that because the rules are so simple, they are easy to modify. If you wish to play in a game where Charisma is an attribute, more power to you!

## Skill

A Skill represent a proficiency of certain tasks a character can perform.

### Skill Level

Skill Level measures how good a character is at a specific skill. Skill Level ranges from level -1 to level 5.

| Level | Narrative Meaning |                                              Description                                              |
| :---: | :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  -1  |    Incompetent    |                                      Incompetent level of skill.                                      |
|   0   |      Novice      |                                     Inexperienced level of skill.                                     |
|   1   |    Apprentice    |                                     The basics have been learned.                                     |
|   2   |       Adept       |        The basics have been fully understood and the more advanced concepts are being learned.        |
|   3   |      Expert      | Advanced concepts have been fully understood and master level concepts are beginning to be introduced. |
|   4   |      Master      |                     Character would be well know in local region for their skill.                     |
|   5   |      Legend      |                          Character would be a living legend for their skill.                          |

### Skill Specialty

Once a skill's Dice Pool is equal to or greater than 8 dice you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill, when asked to make a check utilizing that skill with a Challenge Level of 3 or less, you automatically pass if all of the following are true.

- You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influences or aggression such as combat.)
- The check is not contested.
- The check is not a reflexive action.

### Multiple Character Skill Check

Multiple characters may contribute to the same skill check. The Narrator should then evaluate the Challenge Level in the context of if multiple characters were performing it. All characters make their skill check, from which the average is taken, always rounding down to the nearest whole number. The average will then determine success or failure.

**Example:**

A character wants to pick up an entire large sturdy treasure chest by themselves and take it up a flight of stairs.

The narrator assigns this a Specialized task (CL 3), not only for the weight of the chest but for how cumbersome it is for one person to move. The character gets 2 Wins on their Lift check. They are not able to get the chest up the stairs.

After a short rest, both the original character and one of there teammates decide to pick up the chest together. The Narrator assigns this a Common task (CL 1) since people do this every day. The two characters both roll their Lift check. One gets 2 wins and the other gets 1 win. The average is 1.5, which rounds down to 1. They can move the chest up the stairs.

## Core Skill

Core Skills are skills that cover the majority of what most creatures can perform outside of Combat Skills. Core Skills are each governed by an Attribute that it would logically fall under.

### Strength Core Skills

#### Athletics

Covers activities related to sprinting, jumping, swimming, climbing, crawling, general movement, throwing/catching objects, ect...

Commonly used by track athletes, swimmers, rock climbers, and professional athletes.

#### Endurance

Covers activities related to cardiovascular endurance, pain tolerance, resisting exhaustion/extreme cold/extreme heat/toxins/diseases/bleeding out/physical wounds worsening out, ect...

Commonly used by ultra-marathon runners.

#### Lift

Covers physical activity related to moving heavy objects, carrying heavy objects, generating mechanical force with the body, ect...

Examples include shouldering a door open, carrying heavy equipment, throwing heavy objects, or crushing/tearing something in your hands.

It will be common for the Narrator to require players to make environmental 'Perception Checks' to gauge how much the characters notice regarding current happenings or places.

#### Stealth

Covers activities related to sneaking, hiding from others, moving quietly, ambushing an opponent, performing actions unnoticed, ect...

Examples include sneaking past a group of city watchmen, hiding within a bush, moving through the forest without stepping on any twigs, remaining motionless as your victim walks into your ambush, snatching a nobleman's coin pouch unnoticed.

Commonly used by politicians, traders, or con men.

#### General Knowledge

Covers activities related to reading ability, absorbing knowledge, recalling information, performing deductive analysis, thinking logically, ect...

Examples include reading quickly through an ancient tomb for a clue as the walls close around you, absorbing the knowledge of the local area from a map, recalling why the symbol on the slain cultists robe looks familiar, deducing that only the butler would have had access to the murder weapon, thinking through what the best way to avoid the local gangs territories in a bad part of town.

Commonly used by historians, bookworms, detectives or street smart individuals.

A character with a specific knowledge skill (such as a Vocational Skill) strongly related to the task being attempted would always have an easier skill check than a character using General Knowledge. For instance, a baker and a detective are trying to determine which pastry shop made the poisoned box of pastries at a crime scene. The baker using his "Baker Knowledge" skill might only be required to achieve a Common skill check (CL 1) were as the detective using his General Knowledge skill might be required to make a Uncommon skill check (CL 2).

## Vocation

Vocations represent your character's job, class, or life path. You should check with your Narrator to make sure that your Vocation exists in the setting. Some traditional fantasy example Vocations include Rogue, Knight, Wizard, Paladin, Cleric, etc... Other examples include Vagrant, Chef, or Sailor. Each vocation has one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it.

### Vocation Level

Vocation Level measures how good a character is at a specific vocation. Vocation Level ranges from level -1 to level 5.

| Level | Narrative Meaning |                                              Description                                              |

|   5   |      Legend      |                         Character would be a living legend for their vocation.                         |

### Vocational Skills

Vocational Skills are skills that fall under your Vocation. These skills have their levels capped by the level of the Vocation they fall under. For instance, if a character had a level 2 Vocation, any skill under it couldn't increase above level 2, until its Vocation level increased.

A Vocation Skill can have one or many Governing Attributes that logically would govern it, which can differ from the Vocation's Governing Attributes. Determining what Governing Attributes a Vocational Skill will have is ultimately up to the Narrator. In general, if it is logical that some change to an Attribute would benefit/hurt the skill in question, than it should be added.

Vocational Skills can often resolve in a single roll what without it would turn into a sequence of possibly more difficult Core Skill checks, which opens up more possibilities for failure. When determining what a Vocational Skills Governing Attributes would be, it is often handy to ask what sequence of Core Skills would be required to attempt the same thing. Based off what Core Skills a character would've had to performed, you can usually infer what Governing Attributes the Vocational Skill will have.

In general, most weapon combat Vocational Skill are governed by STR, RFX, and INT. Being stronger, faster, and smarter is almost always better when fighting.

**Examples:**

Below are some examples of Vocational Skills for certain Vocations.

### Rogue Example

Let's make a Rogue vocation.

Our character has 0 STR, 1 RFX, and 1 INT.

We set our "Rogue" Vocation to Level 2, meaning we are an adept rogue.

For the Governing Attributes of Rogue, we take RFX and INT as our vocation would benefit from us being quick, dexterous, and cunning.

I add "Lock-picking" as a Vocational Skill as it is something a Rogue would do. For it's Governing Attributes I give it RFX and INT, as being nimble with my fingers and understanding the mechanics of the lock would benefit this skill. We set it's level to Level 2.

I add "Pickpocketing" as a Vocational Skill as it is something a Rogue would do. For it's Governing Attributes I give it RFX and INT, as being nimble with my fingers and understanding deceptive misdirection would benefit this skill. We set it's level to Level 2.

I add "Infiltration Knowledge" as a Vocational Skill, as it is something a Rogue would do. For it's Governing Attributes, I give it just INT, as being more cunning would aid me as I lay out my plan. We set it's Level to Level 2.

Finally, I add "Small Melee" as a Vocational Skill, as using a knife or blackjack would be something a Rogue would do. For it's Governing Attributes, I give it STR, RFX, and INT, as being stronger, faster, and smarter would all benefit this skill. We set it's level to Level 1.

| Rogue                  |   RFX, INT   | 2 | 7d6 |
| ---------------------- | :-----------: | :-: | :-: |
| Lock-picking           |   RFX, INT   | 2 | 7d6 |
| Pickpocketing          |   RFX, INT   | 2 | 7d6 |
| Infiltration Knowledge |      INT      | 2 | 6d6 |
| Small Blade            | STR, RFX, INT | 1 | 7d6 |

### Chef Example

Let's make a Chef vocation.

Our Character has 1 STR, 1 RFX, and 0 INT.

We set our Chef Vocation to Level 3, meaning we are an expert chef.

For the Governing Attributes of Chef, we take RFX and INT. RFX as chefs use their senses to smell, taste, and quick fine motor control of their hands. INT makes sense as they have to have a vast knowledge of recipes and flavor combinations.

I add "Wine Tasting" as a Vocational Skill, as it is something a Chef would do. For it's Governing Attributes, I give it RFX and INT. RFX makes sense as a Chef would have to use their sense to smell and taste for the wine. INT makes sense as they'd have to have a vast knowledge of wine types and have knowledge of what were good years when the grapes were grown. We set it's Level to 3.

I add "Chopping Food" as a Vocational Skill, as it is something a Chef would do. For it's Governing Attributes, I give it just RFX. RFX makes sense as they'd have to use fine motor control with their hands to chop quickly. We set it's level to 3.

I add "Small Melee" as a Vocational Skill, as using knives in a kitchen would be something a Chef would do. This Vocational Skill could be disputed by a Narrator, as Chefs generally aren't stabbing people, but depending on how serious their setting is this might be fine. For it's Governing Attributes, I give it STR, RFX, and INT, as being stronger, faster, and smarter would all benefit this skill. We set it's level to Level 1.

I try and add the "Reach Spear" Vocational Skill. I realized using a long spear is not something that a chef would do, so I can't add it under my vocation.

| Chef             |   RFX, INT   | 3 | 7d6 |
| ---------------- | :-----------: | :-: | :-: |
| Wine Tasting     |   RFX, INT   | 3 | 7d6 |
| Chopping Food    |      RFX      | 3 | 7d6 |
| Small Blade      | STR, RFX, INT | 1 | 6d6 |
| ~~Reach Spear~~ |              |  |    |

## Tied Contested Checks

Contested Checks occur when two character's actions conflict. The most obvious example of this is fighting, though other examples include drinking contests, arm wrestling, or stealth vs perception.

When a Tied Contested Check occurs, neither side makes any progress and the contested check is a stalemate. If this contested check happens within a combat round, than the stalemate is only applicable on that round. After The Narrator has narratively described the stalemate if both sides initiate the contested check again, they roll off again.

Sometimes, a character might actually want a stalemate with neither side making progress. Here are some examples:

- If a character is fighting a foe they have no chance of handling on there own, a stalemate is good as just holding them off until backup arrives is the smart move.
- If a character is already successfully hidden from their opponent, then when their opponent tries to detect where they are hiding, a stalemate means they get to remain in stealth.
- If a character is trying to keep there eyes on an enemy trying to hidden, then when their opponent tries to hide, a stalemate means they can still see the opponent.

**Combat example 1:**

Two characters are in combat and roll their dice pools versus one another. Each of them gets 2 wins on their combat roll. They clash but aren't able to injure each other.

**Combat example 2:**

A rogue and a knight are fighting each other in combat. The rogue wants to use the dim light of the room to get around the knight and sneak attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contested check is a stalemate and the rogue is not able to enter into stealth. Looks like he'll have to fight him without the aid of the shadows this round.

**Combat example 3:**

A rogue and a knight are fighting each other in combat. The rogue has already used the dim light of the room to successfully hide behind some crates last round. The knight declares he is trying to find the rogue on his turn and attack him. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The contest check is a stalemate and the rogue remains hidden. The rogue uses his stealth to sneak attack the knight.

**Non-combat example:**

Outside of combat, a rogue is trying to sneak up on a knight. The rogue rolls stealth and the knight rolls perception. They both get 2 wins. The guard thinks to himself that maybe it was just the wind as he peers into the darkness. The round holds his breath, heart pounding as he tries to remain motionless. They reroll to determine a clear winner.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage and Disadvantage represent circumstances that favor or disfavor a character, resulting in better or worse odds of achieving Wins on a dice pool roll.

### Advantage

Advantage is gained when circumstance favors a character. For any dice rolled, 3's count as wins for that roll.

### Disadvantage

Disadvantage is gained when circumstance disfavors a character. For any dice rolled, 4's count as failures for that roll.

### Super Advantage

Gained under very specific conditions when the stars have aligned for a character. For any dice rolled, 3s and 2s count as wins for that roll.

### Super Disadvantage

Gained under very specific conditions when a character has truly drawn the short straw. For any dice rolled, 4's and 5's count as failures for that roll.

### Super Advantage/Disadvantage overriding Advantage/Disadvantage

Super Advantage/Disadvantage completely overrides Advantage and Disadvantage on any roll.

### Multiple Advantages and Disadvantages on a roll

For a given roll, one source of Advantage will cancel out with one source of Disadvantage, and vice versa.

If after canceling out Advantage and Disadvantage a character is left with neither Advantage or Disadvantage, then they would roll normally. Else if a character is left with one or multiple sources of Advantage, then they would roll with Advantage. Else if a character is left with one or multiple sources of Disadvantage, then they would roll with Disadvantage.

In the extreme case that a character has Super Advantage and Super Disadvantage, they cancel out the same way Advantage and Disadvantage do.

## Assists

With Assists, a character can give Advantage (or if rolled poorly, Disadvantage) with an "assisting" Dice Pool Skill Check to a "primary" Dice Pool Skill Check. Characters can Assist themselves or another character. The "assisting" Dice Pools must be rolled first. The "assisting" Dice Pool can be a Skill or Vocation. The "primary" Dice Pool can be a Skill.

It must make logical sense to the Narrator as to why the "assisting" Dice Pool would aid the "primary" Dice Pool. Player's should recognize when they are stretching logic and Narrators should recognize when the player's come up with creative applications of Assists. It's up to the players and the Narrator to explain/negotiate how these assists make logical sense for the current circumstance.

Assists can never use the same Skill for the "assisting" and "primary" Dice Pools. For instance, a character could never assist another character's Lift Check with their own Lift Check, they would instead use the Multiple Character Skill Check rules.

Multiple characters can assist the same "primary" Dice Pool. If they are assisting using the same skill, then there assists rolls will use the Multiple Character Skill Check rules for that assist. If they are using different skills/vocations as assists, handle each assist roll separately before seeing if the resulting Advantages/Disadvantages cancel out, with whatever remains being applied to the "primary" Dice Pool.

**The CL for Assists starts at CL 3 and should RARELY be lower than that.** However, it is up to the Narrator to decide if it should be higher than CL 3. In general, most Assists, unless extremely unlikely to aid the current situation, will be made at CL 3.

If the "assisting" Dice Pool achieved more Wins than the Assist CL, Advantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool. If the "assisting" Dice Pool achieved Wins equal to the Assist CL, neither advantage or disadvantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool. If the Assist check achieved fewer Wins than the Assists CL, Disadvantage is gained on the "primary" Dice Pool.

**Example 1:**

Thrak the Barbarian is trying to lift a big rock. Bob the Bard decides he is going to play some motivational music on his guitar to Assist Thrak. In this example, Thrak's Lift is the "primary" Dice Pool and Bob's Performance Vocational Skill is the "assisting" Dice Pool.

The Narrator agrees as it makes logical sense. The narrator sets a CL 3 Performance Check for the assists. Bob rolls his Performance Vocational skill and gets 4 wins, resulting in Advantage for Thrak's Lift Check. In a parallel reality, Bob only gets 3 wins, and his song doesn't help or hurt Thrak's Check. In another parallel reality, Bob only gets 2 wins on his Performance Check, which produces such horrible music it distracts Thrak resulting in Disadvantage to Thrak's Lift Check.

**Example 2:**

Javk Wick the rogue is sneaking up on a guard. Javk's player asks the narrator if he could assist his Stealth check to sneak up with his Rogue Vocation. He asks the Narrator if he could Assist his Stealth check with his Rogue Vocation since being a good Rogue would aid his sneakiness. In this example, Stealth is the "primary" Dice Pool and Rogue is the "assisting" Dice Pool.

The Narrator agrees as it makes logical sense. The Narrator sets the CL of the Assist at 3. Javk gets 4 Wins from his Assist, giving him advantage on his Stealth check.

**Example 3:**

Javk Wick the rogue is in combat. He wants to do some fancy foot work combined with acrobatic maneuvers to give him an edge as he uses his dagger in a melee clash as slippery oil patches cover the floor. Javk's player asks the narrator if he could assist his dagger's combat roll with his Dexterity skill. In this example, Dexterity is the "primary" Dice Pool and the dagger's combat roll is the "assisting" Dice Pool.

The Narrator agrees, setting the assist to CL 3 due to the slippery oil patches cover the floor. Javk gets 4 Wins from his Assist, giving him advantage on his dagger's combat roll.

Your Uses Per Round is reduced to 1 for the round.                                                                                        | 1 Round |  CL 3 Stealth Check  |

Your Uses Per Round is reduced to 1 for the round.                                                                                                    | 1 Round | CL 3 Perception Check |
|    Assist: Charge    |     If there is 10 ft between the character and an opponent, they may add their momentum to their melee attack.

| Assist: Pack Tactics |                                            When two or more attackers make a combat roll against the same opponent with at least one of them within 5 feet, they can make this collaborative assist roll. If successful, they can coordinate their attacks, gaining Advantage on their attack rolls.                                            | 1 Round |  CL 3 Teamwork Check  |

If the assist is successful, then all characters within the formation gain Advantage to their Melee or Reach range combat rolls.                                                           | 1 Round |  CL 3 Teamwork Check  |

## Base Dice Tiers

## Destiny Points

A Destiny Point represents a player's ability to tip the scales of fate in favor of their character.

Destiny Point Effects are for the following two kinds of characters:

- Player Characters are given "Destiny Points" and "Destiny Resistance" by default. "Destiny Points" allows players to influence the story at key moments they decide. "Destiny Resistance" is mainly to prevent Player Characters from wasting all there Destiny Points against one another on silly rolls.
- Villain/Boss NPC can be given different combinations of these effects to dramatically increase how dangerous they are. Nothing scares players quite like telling them Destiny Points don't work versus a powerful foe...

|   Destiny Points   | (0/3) A character can hold a max of 3 Destiny Points. Spending a "Preemptive Destiny Point" before rolling a dice pool gives Advantage on the resulting roll. Spending "Post Roll Destiny Points" adds additional Wins for each point spent, with the total Wins never exceeding the size of the dice pool. Destiny points are awarded when players perform actions that the narrator wants to encourage. Examples include showing up to the game on time, exceptional roleplay, accomplishing a narrative milestone, and doing something in line with their character's personality even if at the detriment of wealth or progress. |          | The Narrator |

### Defending Skill

Certain Damage Types can be defended against with a skill check.

Wins determined by a Defending Skill Check plus any Defense you might have against this specific damage source act as your Total Defense against that injury.

The character may also abstain from rolling, choosing to take the average number of wins given the size of the dice pool. This can be calculated by dividing the number of dice rolled by 2 and then rounding down.

## Defense

Defense is used to reduce incoming injuries from specific Damage Types by the equivalent amount of Defense against it. If a character has multiple Defenses, then add the values of the Defenses together for each Damage Type to get their Total Defense. If a Totaled Defense to a specific Damage Type has a decimal place remainder, you'll round it down to the nearest whole number when reducing an injury with it.

If a foe has a sufficiently high Defense to certain Damage Types, then the best course of action is to circumvent it. For instance, a knight in full Plate Armor is extremely difficult to injury with Slash damage. In these circumstances, the most efficient way of defeating a person in heavy armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life. Another option is to use an attack with a different Damage Type, such as spraying poison mist at them, to completely circumvent there high Slash defense.

### Armor

Most Armor has a Defense. For item creation purposes, determining what portions a piece of armor will protect is useful.

- Head Armor
- Body Armor
- Arm Armor
- Leg Armor
- Shield

A character can wear two pieces of armor on the same body part, such as wearing a gambeson shirt under chain mail shirt or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history.

Shields generally takes up one of the character's hands when in use. Characters not actively using their shield as part of their combat/evasion roll do not benefit from the additional defense. Characters that are Off Guard or being attacked while unaware also do not benefit from the shield's defense.

### What to do about attacks with Multiple damage types

If a combat roll has a Physical damage type and a Bodily, Mental, or Spiritual damage type, then since it is combined with the physical attack it is only versus physical defense. An example would be poison applied to the blade of a weapon.

## Penetration

Penetration represents a dealt injuries ability to mitigate the opponent's Defense. While dealing an injury, you may reduce your opponent's Totaled Defense by your Combat Roll's Penetration before calculating injury.

Examples of narratively describing better penetration:

- Firearm vs Firearm loaded with armor piercing bullets.
- Poison shot vs poison aerosolized spray, making it far more likely to penetrate the bodies natural defenses.
- Arming Sword swing vs Great Sword swing, which just give you more leverage and mass because if you can't cut through at least you'll crunch what's underneath.

## Range

A Range determines the distance at which some action can be performed.

Length is measured in ft.

A Range has an Effective, optional Ineffective, and optional Max component to it.

The Effective, Ineffective, and Max components of a Range are usually represented on a character sheet in the "Effective/Ineffective/Max" format. For example, "100/200/300" translates to an Effective Range of 100 ft, an Ineffective Range of 200 ft, and a Max Range of 300 ft. If a Range doesn't have a Ineffective or Max component, you would simply write "None", such as "100/None/None"

When using a Range on a battlemap, if any of the components of the Range have a decimal remainder, round down to the nearest multiple of 5 ft.

**Effective Range:** Less than or equal to the Effective component of a Range, dice pool rolls are unchanged.

**Ineffective Range:** Greater than the Effective component of a Range but less than or equal to the Ineffective component of a Range, dice pool rolls gain Disadvantage.

**Max Range:** Greater than the Ineffective component of a Range but less than or equal to the Max component of a Range, dice pool rolls gain Super Disadvantage.

Ranges with "... Per Dice" parts of there components scales with the size of the Skill Dice Pool they are associated with. This could be used for magic users, with the size of their area of effects scaling with their proficiency with their magic. This could also just be getting more skillful with a weapon.

When calculating a component of a Range, for example Effective Range, you first multiply "Effective Range Per Dice" by the current size of the governing skill dice pool. You than take that result and add it to the "Effective Range Base".

Effective Range = (Effective Range Base) + ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) * (Effective Range Per Dice) )

Ineffective Range = (Ineffective Range Base) + ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) * (Ineffective Range Per Dice) )

Max Range = (Max Range Base) + ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) * (Max Range Per Dice) )

## Area Of Effect

An Area Of Effect describe a 3D space. This is often used for certain attacks such as a grenade explosion that effects an area.

Length is measured in ft. Area is measured in ft^2. Volume is measured in ft^3. Angles are measured in degrees.

All Area Of Effects will have a point of origin from which the area of effect will emanate from.

An Area Of Effect has a Effective, optional Ineffective, and optional Max component to it. They will all share the same point of origin. The shape that the Effective component describes will always be smaller than the Ineffective component, and the Ineffective component will always be smaller than the Max component. A good example would be a modern hand grenade, where the Effective component might represent the inner most "kill radius", the Ineffective component would represent the middle "casualty radius", and the Max component would represent the outer most radius where you might get hit by a piece of shrapnel though highly unlikely.

When dealing with a character between two of the components, such as on the edge between Effective and Ineffective, it is up to the Narrators discretion to decide if they are more inside one or the other.

**Effective Area Of Effect:** Within the Effective component of an Area of Effect, dice pool rolls are unchanged.

**Ineffective Area Of Effect:** Within the Ineffective component of an Area Of Effect, but excluding the Effective component, the dice pool roll creating this Area Of Effect gains Disadvantage.

**Max Area Of Effect:** Within the Max component of an Area Of Effect, but excluding the Ineffective component, the dice pool roll creating this Area Of Effect gains Super Disadvantage.

Area Of Effects with "... Per Dice" parts of there components scales with the size of the Skill Dice Pool they are associated with. This could be used for magic users, with the size of their area of effects scaling with their proficiency with their magic.

### Sphere

Point of Origin: A Sphere's point of origin will be at there center.

Effective Radius = (Effective Radius Base) + ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) * (Effective Radius Per Dice) )

Ineffective Radius = (Ineffective Radius Base) + ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) * (Ineffective Radius Per Dice) )

### Cone

Point of Origin: A Cone point of origin will be the narrowest point of the cone, from which it will emanate out from.

If a cone has an angle of 53.13, than the cone's width is equal to its length at any given point. which means that the cone's area of effect is specified by its maximum length. For example, a cone spell with a range of 15 ft will extend up to 15 ft away from the point of origin, and at any point, its width matches its length.

Effective Length = (Effective Length Base) + ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) * (Effective Length Per Dice) )

Ineffective Length = (Ineffective Length Base) + ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) * (Ineffective Length Per Dice) )

Max Length = (Max Length Base) + ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) * (Max Length Per Dice) )

### Range and Area Of Effects

If an action, such as an attack or spell, has a Range and an Area Of Effect, then the Range describe how far away the point of origin can be for the Area Of Effect.

Cases will arise when an action is performed with a combination of Effective/Ineffective/Max Range and Effective/Ineffective/Max Area Of Effect. We can simply use our rules for resolving multiple Advantages and Disadvantages for handling these cases. The below table shows what the result of these would be.

**Example:**

|                  | Effective Area Of Effect |               Ineffective Area Of Effect               |                        Max Area Of Effect                        |
| :---------------: | :----------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  Effective Range  |       Normal Roll       |                      Disadvantage                      |                        Super Disadvantage                        |
| Ineffective Range |       Disadvantage       |            2 x Disadvantage => Disadvantage            | Disadvantage + Super DisSuper Disadvantage => Super Disadvantage |
|     Max Range     |    Super Disadvantage    | Super Disadvantage + Disadvantage => Super Disadvantage |           2 x Super Disadvantage => Super Disadvantage           |

## Uses Per Round

Uses Per Round represent the number of times some skill governed action can be preformed in a round. Taking firearms as an example, the faster the fire rate and easier it is to reload, the better it's Uses Per Round should be. A flint lock pistol should have a far slower Uses Per Round as compared to a modern pistol.

If a character completely depletes their Uses Per Round for a combat round they can no longer use their combat roll for that combat round and are instead forced to use an Evasion Roll if they are being attacked.

Uses Per Round is calculated using the following equation:

Amount From Governing Skill Dice = if Divisor Option is "None" then 0 else ( (Size of governing skill dice pool) / (Divisor) )

Uses Per Round = (Base) + (Amount From Governing Skill Dice), rounded down to the nearest whole number only if above 1, up to the value of Max Option if not "None"

For example, if a character's' governing skill dice pool had 7 dice and their combat roll has a Uses Per Round of "Quick", then 7 + 0 is 7, divided by 3 is 2.333, which rounded down is 2. There is no "Max Option" for "Quick" so they would have 2 Uses Per Round for that round.

#### Uses Per Round calculations resulting in less than 1

On a round where an action IS prepared (example: your Heavy Crossbow is loaded), you can perform the action 1 time.

On a round where an action is NOT prepared (example: your Heavy Crossbow is unloaded), if the Uses Per Round calculation result is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than 1, 1 round must be spend preparing in order to use this action again. If the result is greater than 0 and less 0.5, your character must spend 2 rounds preparing. While preparing the "Off Guard" Combat Modifier is gained. If engaged during this time characters can still attempt to perform an Evasion Roll.

#### Uses Per Round if character is using multiple loaded weapons

If characters have loaded weapons (for instance loaded muzzle loading firearms) within easy access to themselves, they can forgo loading, and use a faster Uses Per Round type that the Narrator decides. For instance, for muzzle loading pistols being drawn from a chest rig, "Swift" seems like a reasonable Uses Per Round type.

## Battle Map

Combat takes place on gridded battle maps, with each square representing a 5 ft by 5 ft square.

## Movement Speed

Movement Speed is used in combat to determine how quickly a character can move before others as well as the total distance they can move in a round. Movement Speed is made up of two portions, Reaction Movement Speed and Raw Movement Speed.

Raw Movement Speed = (Raw Movement Speed Base) + ( (Amount From Governing Skill Dice) * (Raw Movement Speed Per Skill Dice) )

Total Movement Speed (Reaction Movement Speed) + (Raw Movement Speed)

### Reaction Movement Speed

Reaction Movement Speed is the initial portion of a character's movement and represents how quick they are to get into motion and act.

While lower Reaction Movement Speed characters are deciding what to do, high Reaction Movement Speed characters are already in motion. This can allow them to disengage from opponents, slip behind a door before it closes, avoid an Area Of Effect they are about to be caught in, close the distance to an opponent, ect...

For each Reaction Movement Speed Option, for the specified Skill, gain the corresponding amount multiplied by the amount of Dice in the Skill's dice pool.

Reaction Movement Speed = (Reaction Movement Speed Base) + ( (Amount From Governing Skill Dice) * (Reaction Movement Speed Per Skill Dice) )

Reaction Movement Speed can be used to resolve circumstances when it is unclear which character moved first or closed some distance. Reaction Movement Speed is used first on a character's turn, with lower Reaction Movement Speed characters considered to have not moved/acted yet. This rule takes inspiration from the gun vs knife debate at close distances, where it is argued that within a certain distance, a quick knife wielder might be able to close the distance before the shooter could get accurate shots on target. The ensuing ranged versus melee combat rolls would be disadvantageous for the ranged combatant as they are in melee reach.

**Example 1:**

A rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an archer who is 5 feet away.

Their respective RFX levels are 1 for the rogue and 0 for the archer.

Their respective Reaction Movement Speeds are 10 feet for the rogue and 5 feet for the archer.

The archer declares he is going to shoot the rogue with his bow as he uses his Movement Speed to stay out of range of the knife.

The rogue declares he is going to close the distance, attack with the knife, and stay on the archer. If the Rogue pulls this off, it will be disadvantageous for the archer since melee versus ranged combat in close quarters favors melee attacks.

Since the Rogue has 5 ft more Reaction Movement Speed, he can move those 5 feet before the archer can lose the arrow, closing the distance. Now they will make combat rolls versus one another, with the archer being at a clear disadvantage.

The archer, now likely wounded from the rogue knife, tries to use the rest of his Movement Speed to stay away from the rogue's knife range. Assuming the Rogue has the same or greater remaining movement speed as the archer, the rogue stays on the archer and the gap is 0 feet, ready to stab him again next round.

**Example 2:**

A rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an archer who is 10 feet away.

Their respective RFX levels are 1 for the rogue and 0 for the archer.

Their respective Reaction Movement Speeds are 10 feet for the rogue and 5 feet for the archer.

The archer declares he is going to shoot the rogue with his bow as he uses his Movement Speed to stay out of range of the knife.

The rogue declares he is going to close the distance, attack with the knife, and stay on the archer. If the Rogue pulls this off, it will be disadvantageous for the archer since melee versus ranged combat in close quarters favors melee attacks.

Since the Rogue has 5 ft more Reaction Movement Speed, he can move those 5 feet before the archer can lose the arrow, closing the distance. With 5 feet between the rogue and the archer, the arrow is shot. The rogue must now try and dodge the arrow, before he can attack, possibly proving fatal.

The archer is then able to flee backward. Assuming he has the same or greater remaining movement speed as the possibly injured rogue, the archer can keep the 5 feet of distance between him and the rogue, never getting stabbed.

**Example 3:**

A crappy rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an archer who is 5 feet away.

Their respective RFX levels are 0 for the rogue and 0 for the archer.

Their respective Reaction Movement Speeds are 10 feet for the rogue and 5 feet for the archer.

The rogue declares he is going to close the distance, attack with the knife, and stay on the archer. If the Rogue pulls this off, it will be disadvantageous for the archer since melee versus ranged combat in close quarters favors melee attacks.

The archer declares he is going to shoot the rogue with his bow as he uses his Movement Speed to stay out of range of the knife.

Since the rogue has the same Reaction Movement Speed as the archer, he is slow to get into motion, which gives the archer time to lose his arrow as he also begins moving. With 5 feet between the rogue and the archer, the arrow is shot. The rogue must now try and dodge the arrow, before he can attack, possibly proving fatal.

The archer is then able to flee backward. Assuming he has the same or greater remaining movement speed as the possibly injured rogue, the archer can keep the 5 feet of distance between him and the rogue, never getting stabbed.

**Example 4:**

A rogue with a dagger is trying to close the distance on an knight who is 5 feet away standing in some slippery mud. The knight is right on the edge of the mud pool, and the rogue realizes if he can attack the knight while he's standing in the mud, he has a better chance of defeating him.

Their respective RFX levels are 1 for the rogue and 0 for the knight.

Their respective Reaction Movement Speeds are 10 feet for the rogue and 5 feet for the archer.

The knight declares he is going to move forward out of the mud and swing on the rogue with the longsword he has in his hands.

The rogue declares he is going to close the distance before the knight moves out of the mud and try to stab the knight in one of his armors chinks.

Since the Rogue has a Reaction Movement Speeds, he can move 5 feet with his Reaction Movement Speed before the knight can move, closing the gap.

Since the knight already had his sword ready to go, combat rolls will be made, but the knight will do so while having to deal with the disadvantageous position being in slippery mud.

### Raw Movement Speed

Raw Movement Speed is the second portion of a character's movement and represents how fast they are once at there top speed.

Raw Movement Speed should always make up a far greater amount of your Total Movement Speed as compared to Reaction Movement Speed. Even though characters with higher Reaction Movement Speed might be quicker to initially move, there is nothing prevent a high Raw Movement Speed character from running them down.

For each Raw Movement Speed Option, for the specified Skill, gain the corresponding amount multiplied by the amount of Dice in the Skill's dice pool.

Raw Movement Speed = (Raw Movement Speed Base) + ( (Amount From Governing Skill Dice) * (Raw Movement Speed Per Skill Dice) )

### Using multiple Movement Speeds on the same round

Whenever a character needs to use multiple movement speeds in a round, calculate what percentage of their movement they've used that round for their initial movement, with the remainder percent being used for another movement speed.

For example, if a character has 30 feet of "Terrestrial" and 15 feet of "Climb Combat Speed". The character walks 15 feet up to a climbable rock face. They've used 50% (15/30 = 0.5) of their movement speed, leaving them 50% of their climb combat speed. 50% of 15 feet is 7.5 feet. Therefore the character can climb 7.5 feet up the rock face.

### Difficult Terrain

Steep mountains, ice-covered ground, swamps, etc. are difficult terrain. It takes twice the movement to move through these terrains.

### Mounted Movement Speed

The rider's Dexterity dice pool size is used for the mounts Reaction Movement Speed calculation.Additionally, when a mounted character or their mount takes an injury in combat, a Dexterity or Riding skill check equivalent to the injury level must be succeeded to stay on horseback, or else they are knocked off.

## Ammo

### Resource Type

Describes a type of resource, which in ammo's case usually describes which weapons can use it.

For example, a "Light Arrow - Standard" and a "Light Arrow - Wounding" both share the Resource Type "Light Arrow". Therefore, any Combat Roll that has an Resource Type of "Light Arrow" could use either of these arrows.

### Dice Pool Mod

Represent either an addition or subtraction of dice to the Combat Roll Dice Pool in which this Ammo is being used. Used to represent Ammo that significantly modifies the combat effectiveness of the Combat Roll.

For example, a bomb arrow is significantly more dangerous than a standard arrow, so it would receive additional dice. However, a blunted practice arrow (such as the comical boxing glove arrow) is significantly less dangerous than a standard arrow, so it would lose dice.

### Base Dice Tier Adjustment

Adjusts the Base Dice Tier level for the Combat Roll the Ammo is being used with. Used to represent Ammo that adjusts the consistency and reliability of the Combat Roll.

For example, let's say a character has a "Light Bow (+0) (Two-handed)" Combat Roll (which has a level 0 Base Dice Tier meaning it's Base Dice would be 3d6 unless otherwise adjusted). If the character were to use a "Light Arrow - Survival" (which would represent a poorly constructed arrow made as a last ditch effort in a survival situation) which has a -1 Base Dice Tier Adjustment, then the Combat Roll would have a -1 Base Dice Tier ("2d6, 1d4" for it's Base Dice). If instead a "Light Arrow - Standard" were used which has a +0 Base Dice Tier Adjustment, then the Combat Roll would have a Base Dice Tier of +0 ("3d6" for it's Base Dice).

### Penetration Adjustment

Adjusts the Penetration for the Combat Roll the Ammo is being used with.

For example, let's say a character has a "Light Bow (+0) (Two-handed)" Combat Roll which has a 0 Penetration. If the character were to use a "Light Arrow - Anti-armor" which has a +1 Penetration Adjustment, then the Combat Roll would have 1 Penetration.

### Damage Types

Overrides the Combat Roll's Damage Types stat with the Damage Types specified by the Ammo.

For example, a flaming arrow might have a Damage Types stat of "Pierce, Fire".

### Range Option

If "None", than use the Combat Roll's Range this Ammo is being used with. Otherwise, override the Combat Roll's Range stat with the Range specified by the Ammo.

This can represent self propelled projectiles, high pressure firearm rounds, ect...

### Area Of Effect Option

If "None", than use the Combat Roll's Area Of Effect this Ammo is being used with. Otherwise, override the Combat Roll's Area Of Effect Option stat with the Area Of Effect specified by the Ammo.

This can represent a bomb arrow, an explosive rounds, ect...

## Combat Roll

Describes how a character is participating in combat. Is your character fist fighting a drunk. Is your character using both of their hands on their greatsword while swinging in large slashing arcs, that's a combat roll. Is a character holding a torch in one hand and firing a pistol in the other, that's a combat roll.

Combat Roll's come on all weapons and offensive spells. Some weapons might even have multiple combat rolls, such as a sword that can either thrust or swung.

The right Combat Roll can dramatically improve the chances of getting more wins in a combat, make it possible to engage opponents at far distances, enable rapid engagement of multiple opponents, deal various types of damages which an opponents might be weak to, etc...

### Name

The name of a Combat Roll is it's Weapon Type, followed by it's Handed Variation in parentheses, followed by it's Base Dice Tier Adjustment amount in parentheses.

For example, let's say we are creating a Combat Roll for one-handed thrusting with a rapier. In regards to Weapon Type, it seems that a rapier would be a "Medium Pierce Melee" weapon. Next, in regards which Handed Variations, since we are only using it in one hand and since most rapier grips only include space for one hand, thus we'd use "One-handed".  Finally, in regards to the Base Dice Tier Adjustment, we note that rapiers were designed to favor the piercing rather than slashing. To reflect this, we could give a +2 Base Dice Tier Adjustment for our one-handed thrusting Combat Roll.

Thus, our rapier would have the below weapons: "Medium Pierce Melee (One-handed) (+2)"

### Weapon Type

Just describes what type of weapon.

### Base Dice Tier Adjustment

Adjusts the Base Dice Tier by the amount specified.

This generally is used to adjust the consistency and/or reliability of the Combat Roll. For instance a "Hand Crossbow (One-handed) (+1)" will have 1d8, 2d6 as it's Base Dice.

The table below only shows the +0 Base Dice Tier Adjustment amount for the sake of brevity.

### Handed Variation

Describes how a character's hands (or other appendages) will be occupied as part of the Combat Roll. This is very important when defining a Combat Roll, as some weapons would be impossible to use with one hand (such as a bow).

**One-handed**

One hand or equivalent appendage is being used. This frees up the other hand to hold a shield, another weapon, an important item, etc...

**Two-handed**

Two hands or equivalent appendages are being used. For characters with only two hands, this means both their hands are required.

**Dual-wielded**

One hand is being used on a main weapon and the other hand is being used on another independent weapon. Only for weapons that wouldn't encumber the user if one were held in each hand (generally Medium to small sized weapons). To dual wield, a character must have at least one skill point in both of the weapons held.

### Dice Pool Mod

Represent either an addition or subtraction of dice to the Combat Roll Dice Pool. Used to represent how significant of a force multiplier a Combat Roll is. The more effective the Combat Roll, the larger the dice pool modification.

### Penetration

The amount of Penetration versus an opponents defense to the Damage Type the Combat Roll deals. See the Penetration rules for more details.

### Range

The distance at the Combat Roll can be used. See the Range rules for more details.

### Uses Per Round

The amount of times a Combat Roll be used during a round. See the Uses Per Round rules for more details.

### Area Of Effect

The shape and dimensions the Combat Roll creates. See the Area Of Effect rules for more details.

### Resource Type And Amount Per Use

The Resource Type required to use the Combat Roll and the amount consumed per use of the Combat Roll. See the Resource Pool and Ammo rules for more details.

### Damage Types

The types of Damage a weapon inflicts when dealing injuries.

### Governing Skill Name

The Skill that governs this combat roll.

### Description

Gives some narrative description of the combat roll. Addition feature specific to the combat roll will be included here, such as being usable while grappled or restricted in confined spaces.

### Duration

Describes how long the Combat Roll effect is usable for. For most conventional weapons, this is "Indefinite". However, if a spell were being used, this may vary.

### Source

Describes where this Combat Roll is coming from. If it is coming from an item the character possess, such as a sword, than the name of the item would be the source. If the Combat Roll is innate to the character, such as claws, than the source would be "Innate".

### Combat Roll Dice Pool

A Combat Roll Dice Pool is the result of the Governing Skill Dice Pool modified by the Combat Roll's "Dice Pool Mod" and "Base Dice Tier Adjustment" ( including the same stats on any Ammo being used as part of the Combat Roll ). This Dice Pool represent's the character's effectiveness in combat.

- +Base Dice (defaults to 3d6, varies with Base Dice Tier Adjustments from the Combat Roll and Ammo)
- +/- 1d6 per Weapon Skill
- +/- 1d6 per STR, RFX, or INT if Governing Attribute of Combat Skill
- +/- Combat Roll's Dice Pool Mods
- +/- Ammo's Dice Pool Mods if used

**Example 1:**

Javk Wick the rogue has a rapier he's dual-wielding with his dagger. This would be the "Medium Pierce Melee (+0) (Dual-wielded)" combat roll. He has level 2 in Medium Melee and level 1 in Small Melee. He has Level 1 RFX.

- +3d6 (Base Dice)
- +2d6 (Level 2 Medium Sword Skill)
- +1d6 (Level 1 RFX)
- +2d6 (Medium Pierce Melee (+0) (Dual-wielded))

Based on the dice above, Javk uses his sword and dagger for thrusting rolls 8d6.

**Example 2:**

Javk Wick the rogue has a Light Crossbow and Light Bolt - Standards. He has a weapon skill of level 1 with the Crossbow Skill. He has level 1 in RFX.

- +3d6 (Base Dice)
- +1d6 (Level 1 Light Crossbow Skill)
- +1d6 (Level 1 RFX)
- +2d6 (Light Crossbow Two-Handed)
- +0d6 (Light Bolt - Standard)

Based on the dice above, Javk using his Light Crossbow has a 7d6.

## Combat Rounds

Combat is run in a Round-by-round format. Each character can perform 1 combat roll within a round (though additional things like climbing as part of your movement or reactively dodging arrows are expected) with liberties regarding the narrative flow of the game. For instance, it doesn't take an action to shout out something to another character while fighting a monster, though it would take a round to explain something complicated.

Actions in combat rounds are not solely movements and attacks. A combat action can be anything a person could do within a few seconds, such as turning over a table with their weapon, swinging from a chandelier, or dropping a boulder onto an enemy. The Narrative flow you develop while playing will guide you in what the players can do in the game, and how long it will take to do it.

### Round Order

Every action within Round-by-Round conflicts happens almost at the same time or in direct succession to one another. This means that one character's action is NOT explicitly followed by another character's action. It should be considered as everything happening together, with the one exception being Reaction Movement Speed.

To make sense of this potential 'chaos', there is a declaration phase and an action phase.

#### Declaration Phase

The character with the lowest RFX declares what they are doing first. That might seem odd as you could think characters with higher RFX should get to move first, but this is the declaration phase, no one is moving yet. If two Characters have the same RFX, they each roll a D6 (though D20s work better), where the highest resulting roll gets to declare later for the rest of the combat encounter.

Players who declare LATER hold the upper hand in combat.

Once a player has declared what they are going to perform, they cannot change their mind. They are locked into performing that action in this round. The players who declare after another can choose an action that counters or complements the declared action of another character.

This means that characters with the highest RFX can see and react to what their opponents are going to do.

#### Action Phase

Once all characters have declared their actions, the order is reversed starting with the person with the highest RFX acting first. Though things mostly happen simultaneously within the round, it's sometimes important to know which blade landed before another, or who managed to perform their action a little bit faster than another. In these situations, characters with a higher reflex will always win.

At the beginning of the Action Phase, all players can roll their dice pools for the actions they expect to take that round, such as combat rolls. This is to help things combat move efficiently.

### Keep your Combat Rolls for the round

Combat Rolls made with them should be held onto during combat after they've been rolled. This is to remember your current victory levels for the round. This is also in case your character loses dice due to injury or they gain Disadvantage/Advantage in that round, which will affect the already rolled dice pool.

#### Removing Dice to an already rolled Dice Pool

Whenever losing dice of the same kind, always remove dice from left to right. This is to leave it up to chance if the dice they lost that round punish or are indifferent to their wins for that round. With physical dice, you can just roughly straighten out the dice and begin removing in that order.

#### Applying Disadvantage/Advantage to an already rolled Combat Roll Dice Pools

If your character gains disadvantage (often the result of a stagger or being knocked prone) or advantage (you engage a prone opponent as your second target with a melee weapon) after you've already rolled a Combat Roll dice pool that round, you will retroactively apply said disadvantage/advantage to your those dice pools. This could turn some dice that were wins into fails and vice versa.

## Evasion Roll

When a Combat Roll is made against a character who is not capable of making an opposing combat roll (i.e. they are using a melee combat roll but are being shot at from far away), the defender can make a reflexive Evasion Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll.

An Evasion Roll will consist of a Skill Roll which represents reflexive dodging, which is almost always "Dexterity". Evasion Roll's can be assisted, often by "Athletics", as faster top speeds can aid in being harder to hit.

As part of the Declaration Phase, if the defending character declared they were going to use an Evasion Roll against specific attacks, than with the Narrators permission, they can choose to Assist with a reasonable Skill.

For instance, if during a round of combat while sieging a castle wall, a Player Character armed with only his greatsword needs to cross between two points of cover. The Player Character knows he is lower in turn order than the archers on the wall, but assumes they are going to fire at him as he crosses between cover. The Player asks if it would be reasonable if he could use the "Athletics" Skill to Assist his Evasion Roll against the assumed archer's Combat Rolls, since the faster his dash is, the harder it will be to land a shot. The Narrator agrees with the logic and allows it.

However, as part of the Declaration Phase, if the defending character DID NOT declare they were going to use an Evasion Roll against specific attacks, than it is up to the Narrator to choose if they should allow an Assist or not.

For instance, if during a round of combat on a grassy field, a Player Character armed with only his greatsword is trying to get within swinging range to an enemy archer. The Player Character knows he is lower in turn order than the archer, and declares he is going to move over to the archer and attack. Since the archer is higher in turn order, declares he will simply move backwards while firing at the Player Character. The archer looses his arrow before the Player Character gets within greatsword range. The Player Character ask's if he can Assist his Evasion Roll with "Athletics", but since the Player Character's declaration had said nothing of doing this with speed, the Narrator doesn't allow the Assist. The Player Character will just have to make a normal Evasion Roll.

Any levels over the defender's Evasion Roll wins count as victories for the attacker.

The only victory level outcome a Evasion Roll can achieve is exiting a grapple. A Combat Roll and Evasion Rolls can both be made in a round.

# Advanced Rules

### Carry Weight

Carry Weight represents a character's ability to carry heavier equipment while still being able to move semi-normally depending on weight class.

For each dice in a character's Lift dice pool the character gains 50 lbs of Carry Weight. Any dice penalty on the Lift dice pool from the characters Weight Class is disregarded for this calculation.

|       Name       | Description |    Duration    |               Source               |
| :--------------: | :--: | :------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| Equipment Weight | 0 lb | While Equipped |             Equipment             |
|   Carry Weight   | ? lb |   Indefinite   | +50 lbs Carry Weight per Lift dice |

## Effects

Effects can be applied to either characters or items, adding buffs/debuffs, weapons, defenses, narrative considerations, injuries, status effects, etc... In a fantasy setting, these could be magical enchantments. In a modern setting, these could be attachments to a rifle.

If you have two different effects active that buff or debuff some feature of your character, these do not stack unless otherwise stated.

The two large categories are "Character Sheet Effects" and "Narrative Effects".

### Character Sheet Effects

"Character Sheet Effects" can essentially be thought of as effects that change something on your character sheet. For instance, if a character gains a Weapon, then they would also gain a new combat roll. If a character gained an Injury, then they'd have to recalculate many of there dice pools with the penalties from the Injuries.

#### Carry Weight

Carry Weight represents a character's ability to carry heavier equipment while still being able to move semi-normally.

Max Carry Weight = (Max Carry Weight Base) + ( (Amount of Dice in Governing Skill Name Dice Pool) * (Max Carry Weight Per Dice) )

|         Name         |       Description       |  Duration  | Source | Governing Skill Name | Max Carry Weight Base | Max Carry Weight Per Dice |           Weight Classes           |
| :-------------------: | :--------------: | :--------: | :----: | :-------------------: | :-------------------: | :-----------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| Humanoid Carry Weight | This is the description | Indefinite | Innate |         Lift         |           0           |            50            | Light, Medium, Heavy, Overburdened |

**Governing Skill Name:** The name of the skill whose dice pool size you will use to calculate Max Carry Weight.

**Max Carry Weight Base:** The base amount of Max Carry Weight for the calculation.

**Max Carry Weight Per Dice:** The amount of additional Max Carry Weight per dice in the governing skill's dice pool.

**Weight Classes:** For a Carry Weight Effect, Weight Classes represent the "classes" a character falls into depending on the percentage of their Max Carry Weight they are currently carrying. If the weight a character is carrying divided by their Max Carry Weight is greater than "Bottom Percent Option" and less than or equal to "Top Percent Option", than that is the character's Weight Class. If either "Bottom Percent Option" or "Top Percent Option" are "None", than they are not used in the above determination. This can be used to describe the lower or upper bond Weight Classes.

Each Weight Class corresponds to an Attribute Dice Mod Effect that will be applied. Each Attribute Dice Mod Effect will almost always effect the same Attributes that Movement Speed relies on, meaning a heavier Weight Class will slow a character's Movement Speed.

|     Name     | Bottom Percent Option | Top Percent Option | Attribute Dice Mod Effect |
| :----------: | :-------------------: | :----------------: | :------------------------: |
|    Light    |         None         |        25.0        |    Weight Class: Light    |
|    Medium    |         25.0         |        50.0        |    Weight Class: Medium    |
|    Heavy    |         50.0         |       100.0       |    Weight Class: Heavy    |
| Overburdened |         100.0         |        None        | Weight Class: Overburdened |

**Example:**

Let's say a character has the "Humanoid Carry Weight", Lift Skill Dice Pool of "3d6", and 30 lbs of equipment on them.

First we calculate the Max Carry Weight, which would be ((3 * 50) + 0) = 150.

Next, we need to determine what percentage of the character's Max Carry Weight their equipment currently taking up, which would be (30 / 150) = 20%.

Therefore, since 20% is less than or equal to 25.0%, the character would have a Weight Class of "Light", which would apply the "Weight Class: Light" Attribute Dice Mod Effect.

#### Containers

Pouches, satchel, sacks, backpacks, chest, etc... are all consider containers. Each container can hold a certain amount of weight and/or volume within.

**Weight Capacity Option:** The weight the container is capable of holding. If "None", than it has unlimited capacity for weight.

**Volume Capacity Option:** The volume the container is capable of holding. If "None", than it has unlimited capacity for volume.

**Include Contents in Weight Calculation:** If true, then the contents of this container would be included in it's' total weight, such as a mundane backpack. If false, then then the contents of this container wouldn't be included in the total weight, such as a bag of holding were it's contents are stored in a pocket dimension.

When representing the contents of a container on a character sheet, a similar table as the one below is used.

**Backpack - 30 lb container:**

Characters will often stash or drop containers during combat as to not be in a heavier Weight Class. This is perfectly acceptable, but it is within the Narrators right to treat these items as fair game to be swiped by the enemy if an opportunity arises, however this might effect their Weight Class as well. Character's wishing to avoid a having their loot stolen can keep it on their backs, by a mount to stash it on, increase their equipment weight, etc...

**Injury:**

Injury is handled as part of the narrative with dice penalties being applied per injury to all a character's dice checks. A character is rendered Physically Incapacitated once they've taken a summed 5 or above injury dice. Typical "status effects" such as being poisoned, frostbitten, bleeding, madness, etc... are handled elegantly through the injury system. For instance, if you were dealt a Serious injury by mild poison mist, then narratively explain it as getting a large breath full. If the character instead was dealt a Serious injury by an extremely lethal poison mist, then narratively it would be explained as only getting a small whiff. The resulting dice penalty acts as your "status effect" debuffing your character until they are resolved. For instance, anti-venom might be able to remove the poison injury or warming up by a fire might reduce hypothermia from the cold.

**Weight Class:**

Represent the physical strain of carrying equipment. Some characters will purposefully be in a higher weight class to gain the benefits of heavier armor and weapons, making up for their Carry weight penalty with better gear.

#### Attribute Level Adjustment

The character charging must move in a straight line, and once a charge is initiated as a portion of a character's movement, their directions must remain constant the entire round. Disadvantage to Dodging while charging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |          1 Round          |      Innate      | ~seconds |   Athletics   |        3        |     None     |           None           |

Character gains Advantage versus charging opponents and charging opponents lose their Advantage versus them. No movement can be used while bracing. Bracing uses the opponent's momentum against them, enabling a prepared defender to more easily stagger, trip or injure the charging opponent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |          1 Round          |      Innate      | ~seconds |      Lift      |        3        |     None     |           None           |

The hologram will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. When physically interacted with, the hologram is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the image, it may discern that it is an hologram by succeeding in a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         1 minute         |      Innate      | ~seconds |  Light Magic  |        0        |   Mediocre   |           None           |

The sound will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. You have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         1 minute         |      Innate      | ~seconds |  Sound Magic  |        0        |   Mediocre   |           None           |

It must be within the effective range of the spell and it persists for the spell's duration. The illusion will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. When you opt for a sound, you have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration, or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. This illusory image lacks the ability to produce sound, light, scent, or any other sensory effects. When physically interacted with, the illusion is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound or image, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding in an Will check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll. If a creature successfully identifies the illusion, it becomes faint and transparent to that creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         1 minute         |      Innate      | ~seconds |   Mind Magic   |        0        |   Mediocre   |           None           |

Throughout the spell's duration, the object emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, accompanied by dim light for an additional 20 feet. You have the freedom to choose the color of the light. Should the object be fully covered with an opaque material, the emitted light is blocked. The spell concludes if cast anew or dismissed through an action. In the event that you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed in a Evasion Roll or Combat Roll to evade the effects of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          1 hour          |      Innate      | ~seconds |  Light Magic  |        0        |    Melee    |           None           |

At Higher Magic Resource, for each additional Magic Resource spent over base amount, healing tier increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       Instantaneous       |      Innate      | ~seconds |   Life Magic   |        1        |    Melee    |           None           |

The target makes a Will Check versus the Magic Skill Roll of this spell. If successful, this spell inflicts an extra Minor Necrotic Injury whenever you inflict an injury. Additionally, you can select one of the target's core skills to impose a disadvantage on. If the target's is rendered unconscious or killed before the spell ends, you have the opportunity to bewitch another creature on a subsequent turn of yours. If a spell remove a curse from a target than this spell ends early.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   Concentration, 1 hour   |      Innate      | ~seconds |   Soul Magic   |        1        |     Long     |           None           |

While the intelligence of many beasts may limit their knowledge and awareness, they can, at a minimum, provide information about nearby locations and creatures, based on their perceptions from the past day. Depending on the Narrator's judgment, you might also be able to persuade a beast to carry out a small task for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |        10 minutes        |      Innate      | ~seconds |  Nature Magic  |        1        |     Self     |           None           |

You can change your height by up to one foot and manipulate your apparent physique to appear thin, fat, or anything in between. However, you cannot alter your fundamental body structure, necessitating adherence to a form with a similar limb arrangement. Beyond this restriction, the extent of changes is within your control. Despite the alterations, if this spell is used to mimic another's appearance, depending on the skill level of the caster certain details might be off at close distances, especially for those that would know the mimicked character. To expose your disguise, a character can spend its action inspecting your appearance and must succeed in an General Knowledge check versus the wins achieved when this spell is cast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |          1 hour          |      Innate      | ~seconds |  Bodily Magic  |        1        |     Self     |           None           |

The target is aware there mind is being probed, and can either make a Communications check to deceive the mental invader, feeding them a false piece of information or Willpower check to force them out of their mind. The target has advantage if they are in combat with the caster or its allies. If the target is unable to resist, roll a d20, with the higher the roll being the more hidden the fact or secret. The target automatically resists the mental invasion if they are immune to being charmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       Instantaneous       |      Innate      | ~seconds |   Mind Magic   |        1        |   Mediocre   |           None           |

This illusion manifests within range and persists for the spell's duration. It remains purely visual, lacking any accompanying sound, smell, or other sensory aspects. Using your action, you can maneuver the illusion to any location within range. As it moves, you can adjust its appearance to mimic natural movements, such as walking for a creature. Physical interaction with the illusion reveals its true nature, as objects pass through it unhindered. A creature can use its action to scrutinize the illusion, potentially discerning its falseness with a successful General Knowledge check against the Magic Skill Roll wins of this spell. Once the illusion is revealed, the creature can see through it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Concentration, 10 minutes |      Innate      | ~seconds |  Light Magic  |        1        |     Far     |           None           |

The target is required to make a Will versus the Magic Skill Rolls of this spell, gaining advantage if already engaged in combat with you or your allies. A failed check results in the creature being charmed (Charmed Condition) by you until the spell's conclusion or until you or your allies take hostile actions towards it. The charmed humanoid perceives you as a friendly acquaintance. Upon the conclusion of the spell, the creature becomes aware that it was under the influence of your charm. At Higher Magic Resource: For each magic resource consumed above it's normal requirement, you can select an additional character to target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          1 hour          |      Innate      | ~seconds |   Mind Magic   |        1        |   Mediocre   |           None           |

Throughout the spell's duration, the ground in this zone transforms into difficult terrain. Any creature caught within the area upon casting must pass a Lift Check versus the spell's wins or restrained condition by the entwining plants until the spell concludes. A creature entangled can use its action to attempt a Lift check versus the spell's Wins. If successful, it breaks free. Once the spell dissipates, the summoned foliage withers and fades away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  Concentration, 1 minute  |      Innate      | ~seconds |  Nature Magic  |        1        |     Far     |           None           |

When you cast the spell you can concentrate your mental focus on any visible creature within the spell's range. If the chosen creature possesses an -2 INT or lacks the ability to communicate through language, the spell has no effect. Initially, you access the surface thoughts of the creature, revealing its predominant concerns at that moment. You have the option to shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or delve deeper into the same creature's mind. When probing deeper, the targeted creature must succeed on a Will check versus the CL of the spell. Failure allows you to glean insights into its reasoning, emotional state, and significant preoccupations (such as worries, affections, or aversions). If successful, the spell terminates. Regardless of the outcome, the targeted creature becomes aware of your mental probing. Unless you shift your focus to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to initiate an Intelligence contest against your own; success terminates the spell. This spell proves particularly effective in interrogations, as questions directed at the target creature naturally influence its thought patterns. Additionally, you can employ this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures that are not visible to you. When casting the spell or as your action during its duration, you can scan for thoughts within the spells range. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead obstruct the ability. Creatures with an -2 INT or those lacking any language are undetectable. Upon detecting the presence of a creature using this method, you can read its thoughts for the remainder of the duration, following the same rules as described earlier, even if the creature is out of sight but still within range. |  Concentration, 1 minute  |      Innate      | ~seconds |   Mind Magic   |        2        |   Mediocre   |           None           |

When activated, causes flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. This sword gains the Fire damage type, and loses the Bleed damage type. The flames last until you  speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword. The blade can only be ignited as long as it is above 3 durability. The sword can be submerged in fire to repair the blade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |        Indefinite        |      Innate      |  1 hour  |   Fire Magic   |        5        |    Melee    |           None           |

#### Ammunitions

See Ammunitions rules for more information.

### Narrative Effects

"Narrative Effects" can essentially be thought of as effects that do not change anything on a character sheet when added.

For instance, a Size Effect doesn't change anything else on your sheet when added, though it could have a massive impact on how a character is played. A potion with a Healing Effect doesn't have any mechanical effect until a player uses it within narrative.

#### Assist

See Assist rules for more information.

#### Combat Modifier

Combat Modifiers represent different circumstances and actions that can occur within combat.

Cover: There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

Can't move, except through Victory Level outcomes or contested checks. Combat Rolls, unless otherwise specified, are considered an Unarmed Combat Roll versus the grappler. Close Melee Combat Rolls are NOT counted as Unarmed Combat Rolls versus the grappler. Medium Melee Combat Rolls are NOT counted as Unarmed Combat Rolls if the grappler is using a Reach Range Melee Combat Roll. Defense from armor is not applicable if narratively bypassable by the grappler. Ends if the grappler is Physically Incapacitated or let's go. | Indefinite |   ?   |

Disadvantage on ranged Combat Rolls made against a Prone character if the Narrator believes they would be smaller target. For instance, shooting a prone opponent 10 feet away wouldn't have Disadvantage. However, shooting a prone sniper at range who is making themselves a small target would incur Disadvantage.

#### Victory Level

- Victory Levels from Physical or Bodily damage can be reduced equal to the amount of STR a character has per combat encounter. If STR is negative, the level of Victory increases by 1.
- Victory levels from Mental or Soul damage can be reduced equal to the amount of INT a character has per combat encounter. If INT is negative, the level of Victory increases by 1.
- Any combination of lower Victory Level outcomes is possible as long as they sum up to be less than or equal to the Victory Level achieved. For instance, with a Level 2 victory, a character could perform both a Stagger and a Minor Injury against there opponent.
- It is mandatory that that the player dealing the Victory Level outcome must describe in awesome detail how they are performing this action. Creativity is encouraged!

The character performing the shove can either roll a Lift check or take the average amount of Wins rounded down. If the character is using magic, they may use a Magic Skill instead of Lift, assuming the magic could shove someone. For each win achieved, the character can shove another character 5 feet in a straight line. For each size category the opponent is smaller than you, double the distance. For each size category, the opponent is larger than you, half the distance. The Narrator can change the shove distance based on unusual circumstances (i.e. humanoid-sized creature weighs as much as a Large sized creature as it is made of pure metal/stone).                                                      | Instant | 1 Victory Level win |

# Magic Rules

## Magic Systems

This page provides a generalized framework for magic system mechanics for any setting. Whether it be the Force from Star Wars, Bending from Avatar, Cyberpunk technomancy, or traditional fantasy magic, this framework should easily accommodate.

Fallen (the setting) has 4 premade magic systems as a reference and example:

- Druidcraft
- Fellcraft
- Runecraft
- Miracles

All magic systems built using this generalized framework require the following pieces of information to be determined.

### Magic Name

This is the name of the Magic in the setting. (Wizardry, Sorcery, Druidic magic, Pact Magic, etc...)

### Magic Vocation Name

This is the name of the Vocation for using that magic in the setting. (Wizard, Sorcerer, Druid, Warlock, etc...)

### Magic Vocation Governing Attributes

Different Magic Vocations rely on different attributes. Most traditional fantasy Magic Vocations have RFX and INT as their Magic Governing Attributes, as most magic benefits from quicker casting times and more knowledge. However, Magic Vocations that narratively rely on a character's physical body, such as genetic bloodline or biological magic, might also include STR as one of its Magic Vocation Governing Attributes.

### Magic Resource Name

Determining what fuels the Magic System is crucial. Is it the will of the caster, their connection with nature, or their connection to a divine entity? An example of a magic resource name is "Mana". See the Magic Resource rules for more information about the actual mechanics.

### Magic Governing Core Skill

A Magic Governing Core Skill is a Core Skill that is associated with a Magic Vocation. Used for instances when a character over-exerts themselves with their Magic Skill from their Magic Vocation, is trying to regain Magic Resource, or maintaining concentration on an already cast spell.

Examples of Magic Governing Core Skills:

* Magic that relies on the body to produce Magic Resource could use Endurance. (Bodily Magic)
* Magic that is equivalent to science or engineering, that relies only on the raw knowledge of the user could use General Knowledge. (Wizard Magic)
* Magic that relies on bending the world around them through sheer will, such as through the mind, emotion, or spirit could use Will. (Sorcery Magic)
* Magic that relies upon a belief in a divine higher power could use Will. (Cleric Magic)
* Magic that relies upon a relationship with a divine being or a pact with a nefarious entity could use Communication, as it is only through the connection to the entity that the magic is held together. (Warlock Magic)
* Magic that relies upon one's ability to communicate with nature could use Communication. (Druidic Magic)

### Magic Skills

A Magic Vocation should contain a list of the Magic Skills that fall under its umbrella. See Magic Skills rules for more information on how to create a Magic Skill list.

### Cantrip Name (Optional)

For a bit of extra flare, determining a new name for Cantrips (or Novice Magic) can make a Magic Vocation feel more unique.

## Magic Resource

The required fuel, energy, or materials required to use magic are known as Magic Resource.

### Magic Resource Pool

Represents the pool of Magic Resource a character has to fuel their magic. Depending on a character's Magic Vocation and the Magic Governing Core Skill, your Magic Resource Pool will vary.

Magic Resource Pool = Vocation Magic Resource + Magic Governing Core Skill Magic Resource

#### Vocation Magic Resource

Vocation Magic Resource = Vocation Level * Vocation Dice Pool Size

- If a Vocation's level is 0, then use 0.5 for the Vocation Level variable in the calculation above and round down to the nearest whole number.

##### Vocation Magic Resource Examples

#### Magic Governing Core Skill Magic Resource

Magic Governing Core Skill Magic Resource = (Magic Governing Core Skill Level * Magic Governing Core Skill Dice Pool Size) / 2, rounded down to the nearest whole number

- If the Magic Governing Core Skill level is 0 or below, then use 0.5 for the Magic Governing Core Skill Level variable in the above calculation.

### Regaining Magic Resource

Detailed below are various ways a character could regain Magic Resource. The amount of Short Rests and Absorbing Magic Resource tasks performed can not exceed your Vocation Level, resetting on long rests.

#### Short Resting

Depending on your magic system, maintaining one's physical health can restore Magic Resource over time. A short rest takes roughly 1 hour and the character does nothing demanding. During this time they can tend to wounds, eat, drink, or relax. Characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Governing Core Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation). If negative or zero, none is regained.

#### Absorbing Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, Magic users can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements/magic/power to regain Magic Resource using a Magic skill. Characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Magic Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation). If negative or zero, none is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the elements/magic/power is acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

#### Long Resting

This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. A long rest of roughly 8 hours of downtime. During this downtime, at least 6 hours must be devoted to sleep. While being awake for no more than 2 hours of a long rest, characters can treat wounds, eat, drink, relax, and stand watch.

## Magic Skills

Magic Skills represent the ability to manipulate and control different magic elements, concepts, or whatever the Narrator desires.

The CL of any Magic Skill check is proportionate to the amount of Magic Resource required as fuel to attempt the roll, unless otherwise stated.

### Unlocking Magic Skills

Novice Tier Magic Skills (level 0) can be unlocked under an appropriate Magic Vocation for 1 skill point.

Incompetent Magic Skills (level -1) can be given by the Narrator as appropriate with the narrative. In general, a character with a level 0 Magic Vocation can have 1 Narrator given Incompetent magic skill, gaining 1 additional Incompetent magic skill per increase to the Magic Vocation Level.

Examples of unlocking Incompetent Magic Skills:

* A minute latent genetic potential, such as from the race of the character. (Sorcerer)
* Partial knowledge of a type of magic learned quickly on the fly without the required study to be considered a novice. (Wizard)
* A minuet blessing bestowed by a deity. (Cleric)
* A taste of power from an entity looking to make a deal... (Warlock)
* A natural element foreign to a character's place of origin. (Druid)

### Magic Skill Roll

Magic Skill Roll =

- 3d6 (Base Dice, varies with Spellcasting Focus Base Dice Tier)
- +Xd6 (per Magic Skill)
- +Xd6 (per Magic Skill Governing Attributes)

### Generic Magic Skill List

Below is a non-exhaustive list of common magic skill, feel free to create your own. You can also try grouping different magic concepts under one magic skill for a magic system. For instance, in the popular video game Skyrim, the Destruction school of magic covered Fire, Ice, and Lightning.

#### Magic Skill Name

The name of the Magic Skill in question. The example Magic Skill Names below are extremely generic. If you are creating a new magic system, these magic skills could have different names.

#### Damage Types

Determines the Damage Types the Magic Skill is capable of inflicting.

#### Melee Capable

Determines if this Magic Skill could be used for melee combat. A good rule of thumb is if it can't create something physical that could block a blow, then it probably isn't Melee Capable.

#### Range Capable

Determines if the Magic Skill in question is capable of affecting something at range, which determines if a Magic Skill can make ranged attacks.

|            Magic Skill Name            |              Damage Types              | Melee Capable | Range Capable |

### Combo Magic Skills

Another avenue to explore is how magic skills could be combined.

- Plasma Magic = Heat Magic + Air Magic
- Storm Magic = Air Magic + Electricity Magic + Water Magic
- Magma Magic = Earth Magic + Heat Magic
- Blizzard Magic = Cold Magic + Air Magic
- Frost Magic = Water Magic + Cold Magic

### Spellcasting Focus

All magic needs a Spellcasting Focus to be cast through wether a wizard's staff, a druid's focus, or even a character's own body. Just about anything can be made into a Spellcasting Focus from a narrative perspective, but it is up to the narrator to decide if their are any restrictions in their magic system/setting.

Spellcasting Focuses often have Skill Base Dice Tier Effects on them that influence the magic skills cast through it, assuming they apply to that skill.

## Spells

Spells are ways a character can use their Magic Skills.

Players can create Spells on the fly with the Narrator's approval. For instance, there is no need to have a predefined Spell for lighting a campfire with Fire Magic or clearing a collapsed tunnel with Earth Magic. The player can just describe what they are about to attempt with their magic and the Narrator will set the CL of the Spell just like any other skill check.

If the created Spell is worth remembering for later use or to share, it can be written down as a Spell such as in the Spell Tables below. It is worth remembering that the Spells on the table below are simply a snapshot of how someone used a Magic Skill for a Spell that they thought was reasonable. If a Narrator wanted to run a game with only pre-defined Spells (such as how D&D does) then they absolutely can.

To use a Spell a character must:

- Have a Magic Skill capable of performing the Spell.
- Achieve the CL required to cast the Spell with their Magic Skill Roll.
- Have enough Magic Resource to consume, which will always be equal to the Spell's CL.

The Magic Resource needed to cast the Spell is always consumed even if the Magic Skill Roll check is unsuccessful.

Certain Spells can consume additional Magic Resource to increase the Spell's effect. A Spell can only consume as much Magic Resource as the wins from the Magic Skill Roll.

### The Need For Reasonable Constraints On Magic

Stories are at there very core about some conflict. Everyone loves well thought our magic systems because they add interesting ways to resolve conflicts within a story. Whether it be the Force from Star Wars, Bending from Avatar, or Wizardry from the Dresden Files, "magic" in each setting gives the heroes and villains new ways to interact with the conflict of the story.

If a Magic System completely trivializes the conflict of the story, than the story won't grip the audience in the same way. Hence, the defining characteristic of really good Magic Systems are believable constraints that allow you to suspend your disbelief. Reasonable constraints, in a strange but true way, are what allow creativity, as without any constraints characters could just instantly resolve the conflict of the story with their magic.

For example, when Luke Skywalker famously picks up the X-wing from the swamp, it makes sense to our brains that it is difficult and straining to move something so large. It took disciple, training, and overcoming his own inner demons to eventually become powerful in the Force. Had Luke had insane Force power from the very beginning with no explanation and instantly defeated the entire Empire with them, I'd argue you'd have a horrible story.

Hence, the whole point of the Fogent Roleplay Magic rules is to help define reasonable constraints on any magic systems. This means the magic systems is constrained enough to not completely break the narrative, but open for creative solutions with magic.

### How To Elegantly Run Magic Systems

The trick with the Fogent Magic system is we already have the most important tools for covering most magic systems, skills and CLs. Whenever a player asks to use their Lift Skill to pick up a rock, the narrator and players already have a rough idea of how hard that check should be. We can use the same intuitive understanding most of us have likely picked up from watch movies, reading books, or playing games to elegantly determine how difficult doing something with magic should be.

It is extremely intuitive that a character with Fire magic could Trivially (CL 0) light a campfire, assuming they have the required wood. In the same vein, it would be common (CL 1) for a character with Fire Magic to shoot a fire bolt at something reasonably close. The point being is that we don't technically need super defined rules for how every Magic Skill exactly works. We as consumers of stories and narratives already reasonably understand what these things should be able to do.

The caveat is that having super defined spells are very nice to have as they allow people to share cool ways they though of to use their magic skills. Therefore, all the defined Spell are just one way someone reasonably thought they could use a Magic Skill. This give the narrator and players the ability to get a rough idea of what a magic skill is capable of at that CL. And if you did want a super "rules-as-written"constrained magic systems, than you can totally just define the exact ways that magic can be used for a magic system or setting. You get to have your cake and eat it too!

### Reasonable Ranges of Spells

Below are guide lines for the Ranges that Magic Skill can be used at for general narrative purposes, usually similar to the Avatar: The Last Air Bender techniques.

A character may attempt to use their magic within the following Ranges depending on how much Magic Resource that is consumed. If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

| Magic Resource Consumed |      Range      |
| :---------------------: | :-------------: |
|            0            | Medium or Melee |
|            1            |  Far or Reach  |
|            2            |      Long      |
|            3            |     Distant     |
|            4            |  Sharpshooter  |

### Spell Concentration

Certain Spells demand a character's concentration to keep their effects active. If this concentration is interrupted, the Spell ends.

If a Spell necessitates concentration, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires concentration. If you cast a spell that needs concentration while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose concentration on the first spell. You can't concentrate on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a Magic Governing Core Skill check to maintain your concentration. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming Physically Incapacitated or dying. If you're Physically Incapacitated or die, you lose concentration on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena might require the concentrating character to succeed on a Governing Core Skill check to maintain concentration. For example, a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship might require a CL 2 Governing Core Skill Check.

### Using Spells In Combat

If a character intends to use Spells during a combat round, on the Declaration Phase they will declare what Spell they are attempting to use with the following rules in mind.

- A character can cast 1 spell per round that uses Magic Resource.
- A character can cast 1 spell per round that does not use Magic Resource.
- A character can only cast 1 spell per turn as their combat roll.

On the Action Phase, the character makes a Magic Skill roll to see if they were able to achieve the Spell they declared. If they succeed, the Spell is cast. If the Spell was a Weapon Spell, than the additional dice from the Weapon Spell are rolled and are combined with the already rolled Magic Skill dice, making up the Magic Combat Roll. If they were unsuccessful in casting the spell, the Spell is not cast but the magic resource is still consumed.

### Weapon Spells

**Casting Time:** Instantaneous

**Duration:** 1 round

From the Magic Skill used to cast this Spell, create flavored magic armaments for use in combat. As part of the same Weapon Spell, an armament can be created in each hand to benefit from the Dual Wielded Modifier or shield. The Defense the shield provides is dependant on the Magic Skill used. For instance, while Earth magic could create a Physical Defense Shield, it could not create a Mental Defense Shield.

Damage Types are determined by the Magic Skill used.

If the Magic Skill used isn't Melee Capable, then any below option with the Range of Melee or Reach is unavailable. If the Magic Skill used isn't Ranged Capable, then any use of any ranged magic is unavailable.

Weapon Spell Combat Roll = (Magic Skill roll) + (Weapon Spell Dice Modifiers)

Almost all traditional offensive magic spells can be represented as Weapon Spells.

- Bone Claws = Bodily Magic Skill + Small Slash Melee (+0) (One-handed), Small Slash Melee (+0) (Dual-wielded)
- Fire Bolt = Fire Magic Skill + Light Crossbow
- Cone of Cold = Cold Magic + Magic Medium Cone
- Water Whip = Water Magic Skill + Whip
- Earth Shield = Earth Magic + Large Shield

The hologram will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. When physically interacted with, the hologram is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the image, it may discern that it is an hologram by succeeding in a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The sound will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. You have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding a General Knowledge check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It must be within the effective range of the spell and it persists for the spell's duration. The illusion will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again. When you opt for a sound, you have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration, or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes. If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed a 5 foot cube. This illusory image lacks the ability to produce sound, light, scent, or any other sensory effects. When physically interacted with, the illusion is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction. If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound or image, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding in an Will check against the wins from the Magic Skill roll. If a creature successfully identifies the illusion, it becomes faint and transparent to that creature. |

Throughout the spell's duration, the object emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, accompanied by dim light for an additional 20 feet. You have the freedom to choose the color of the light. Should the object be fully covered with an opaque material, the emitted light is blocked. The spell concludes if cast anew or dismissed through an action. In the event that you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed in a Evasion Roll or Combat Roll to evade the effects of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Its functions include manipulating objects, opening unlocked doors or containers, stowing or retrieving items from open containers, and pouring the contents out of a vial. The hand's movement speed is equal to it's effective range. It is roughly as strong as the users hand.

The target makes a Will Check versus the Magic Skill Roll of this spell. If successful, this spell inflicts an extra Minor Necrotic Injury whenever you inflict an injury. Additionally, you can select one of the target's core skills to impose a disadvantage on. If the target's is rendered unconscious or killed before the spell ends, you have the opportunity to bewitch another creature on a subsequent turn of yours. If a spell remove a curse from a target than this spell ends early.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

You can change your height by up to one foot and manipulate your apparent physique to appear thin, fat, or anything in between. However, you cannot alter your fundamental body structure, necessitating adherence to a form with a similar limb arrangement. Beyond this restriction, the extent of changes is within your control. Despite the alterations, if this spell is used to mimic another's appearance, depending on the skill level of the caster certain details might be off at close distances, especially for those that would know the mimicked character. To expose your disguise, a character can spend its action inspecting your appearance and must succeed in an General Knowledge check versus the wins achieved when this spell is cast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The target is aware there mind is being probed, and can either make a Communications check to deceive the mental invader, feeding them a false piece of information or Willpower check to force them out of their mind. The target has advantage if they are in combat with the caster or its allies. If the target is unable to resist, roll a d20, with the higher the roll being the more hidden the fact or secret. The target automatically resists the mental invasion if they are immune to being charmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This illusion manifests within range and persists for the spell's duration. It remains purely visual, lacking any accompanying sound, smell, or other sensory aspects. Using your action, you can maneuver the illusion to any location within range. As it moves, you can adjust its appearance to mimic natural movements, such as walking for a creature. Physical interaction with the illusion reveals its true nature, as objects pass through it unhindered. A creature can use its action to scrutinize the illusion, potentially discerning its falseness with a successful General Knowledge check against the Magic Skill Roll wins of this spell. Once the illusion is revealed, the creature can see through it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The target is required to make a Will versus the Magic Skill Rolls of this spell, gaining advantage if already engaged in combat with you or your allies. A failed check results in the creature being charmed (Charmed Condition) by you until the spell's conclusion or until you or your allies take hostile actions towards it. The charmed humanoid perceives you as a friendly acquaintance. Upon the conclusion of the spell, the creature becomes aware that it was under the influence of your charm. At Higher Magic Resource: For each magic resource consumed above it's normal requirement, you can select an additional character to target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Throughout the spell's duration, the ground in this zone transforms into difficult terrain. Any creature caught within the area upon casting must pass a Lift Check versus the spell's wins or restrained condition by the entwining plants until the spell concludes. A creature entangled can use its action to attempt a Lift check versus the spell's Wins. If successful, it breaks free. Once the spell dissipates, the summoned foliage withers and fades away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

When you cast the spell you can concentrate your mental focus on any visible creature within the spell's range. If the chosen creature possesses an -2 INT or lacks the ability to communicate through language, the spell has no effect. Initially, you access the surface thoughts of the creature, revealing its predominant concerns at that moment. You have the option to shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or delve deeper into the same creature's mind. When probing deeper, the targeted creature must succeed on a Will check versus the CL of the spell. Failure allows you to glean insights into its reasoning, emotional state, and significant preoccupations (such as worries, affections, or aversions). If successful, the spell terminates. Regardless of the outcome, the targeted creature becomes aware of your mental probing. Unless you shift your focus to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to initiate an Intelligence contest against your own; success terminates the spell. This spell proves particularly effective in interrogations, as questions directed at the target creature naturally influence its thought patterns. Additionally, you can employ this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures that are not visible to you. When casting the spell or as your action during its duration, you can scan for thoughts within the spells range. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead obstruct the ability. Creatures with an -2 INT or those lacking any language are undetectable. Upon detecting the presence of a creature using this method, you can read its thoughts for the remainder of the duration, following the same rules as described earlier, even if the creature is out of sight but still within range. |

## Disabling Characteristics

Disabling characteristics represent flaws your character has. This is an essential part of every great character as everyone needs a shortcoming to overcome or a temptation to fall into. It should be noted that disabling characteristics can be remedied through narrative with the narrator's approval. If Disabling Characteristics are gained mid-campaign, it should make intuitive sense for that character. Maybe they picked up an addiction, got their heart broken, have a new fear of a monster they've recently faced or are suffering the long-lasting impact of a serious injury they took. Regardless this should be a negotiation between the player and narrator.

## Tier Of Play

### Stuff to move down

Two kinds of skills fall under a Vocation, Vocational Skills and Combat Skills.

## Weapon Combat Skills

A Weapon Combat Skill covers the use of a group of similar weapons. The tables over on the Weapons rules show which weapons are group under which Weapon Combat Skills. For instance, the "Medium Melee" Weapon Combat Skill covers the use of "Medium Hafted", "Medium Sword", and "Medium Spear".

All Weapon Combat Skills have the governing attributes of STR, RFX, and INT. This is to reflect that the stronger, faster, and smarter a character is, the more lethal they are in combat regardless of the weapon. A STR character hits harder, is tougher, and is more conditioned for combat. A RFX character hits faster and is harder to pin down. An INT character hits smarter and uses tactics. It is the player's/narrator's job to flavor their attacks to reflect how they are leveraging their innate attributes as they fight.

### Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

There is obviously overlap certain Weapon Combat Skills. For melee Weapon Combat Skills, weapon reach, footwork, and the biomechanics of swinging a weapon have some overlap. For ranged Weapon Combat Skills, having a proper base, judging the distance, leading your targets, aiming and releasing the projectile smoothly are examples of the overlap. Narrators should allow a character to gain Weapon Combat Skills, though of a lesser level, in similar Weapon Combat Skills in regards to size and function. This not only allows characters to experiment with new weapons but also makes narrative sense.

Starting with the weapon skill your character currently possesses, each horizontal (right and left on the table) or vertical (up and down on the table) jump is -1 reduction to the skill you've moved to. When moving horizontally within a Size type, you may loop around the other side of the table as if it were right beside it. You cannot go below 0 on a combat skill for either melee or ranged weapons via the table below.

#### Melee Weapon Combat Skill Transfer

|   Weapons   |
| :----------: |
| Close Melee |
| Medium Melee |
| Large Melee |
| Reach Melee |

#### Bow/Crossbow Weapon Skill Transfer

| Size/Type |   Bows   |   Crossbows   |
| :-------: | :-------: | :------------: |
|   Hand   |          | Hand Crossbow |
|   Light   | Light Bow | Light Crossbow |
|   Heavy   | Heavy Bow | Heavy Crossbow |

#### Guns

|   Weapons   |
| :---------: |
| Small Guns |
| Medium Guns |
| Heavy Guns |

#### Respecing Combat Skills

Since certain weapon sizes provide more combat skill transfer than others, it is intend for the narrator to allow rebalancing skill point investments as to not waste skill levels as long as all previously know skills maintain they're skill level.

For example, a character has just been given 1 skill point to spend and has a level 3 in Small Blade. They wish to invest their skill point into the Medium Sword skill to try a new magic sword they found. Since they have a 3 in Small Blade already, by the Weapon Combat Skill Transfer rules they have a level 2 in Medium Sword. If they were to invest their skill point into Medium Sword to bring it to level 3, they are technically wasting skill points as had they from the start only invested the 3 skill points from Small Blade into Medium sword, with the addition of the unspent skill point, they'd have a level 4 in Medium sword, which would also give them a level 3 in Small Blade. Instead of wasting skill points, they can take the 3 skill points from Small Blade and the 1 unspent skill point and spend it on bring Medium sword to level 4. Since having a level 4 in Medium Sword gives a level 3 in Small Blade, nothing has changed in Small Blade.

#### Combat Skills

Combat Skills are skills that are used for fighting, including all Weapon Combat Skills and Combat Magic Skills. These skills require skill points to be increased.

#### Vocational Skills

Vocational Skills are skills that your Vocation would logically give you. A Vocational Skill's level is inherited from Vocation's level. Players can make Vocational Skills at any point with approval from the Narrator and use them for applicable skill checks.

Vocational Skills will often overlap with one or more Core Skills, though they will represent a much more specialized subset of tasks. Often times a Vocational Skill will combine what would usually be multiple sequential harder Core Skill checks into a single often easier Vocational Skill check.

Vocational Skills can never cover a majority of what a Core Skill covers. You can not assist Vocational Skills with the Vocation they fall under, as they are essentially relying on the same shared skill point investment.

It is smart to write down Vocational Skills under your vocation as a reminder to have on your character sheet.

Tier Of Play narratively describes the stakes of the campaign as well as how powerful/competent player characters are. This balances the players against each other and the challenges the Narrator has envisioned.

The Narrator should let the players know the Tier Of Play and players should factor this into their characters. It would be silly to have a character's backstory paint them as a badass only to have them start at Apprentice Tier. Also, realize that your character will grow throughout their story and the Narrator will be rewarding players with ways to improve your character as they play.

Whenever building a character starting at a higher level than 1, you must build that character as if they were starting from level 1.

### Tier of Play Breakdown

#### Skill/Vocation Level Cap

This is the maximum you can take any skill or vocation level to in the Tier Of Play.

#### Vocation Point

Points that can only be spent to unlock or upgrade Vocations.

#### Attribute Points

The number of points you can spend to increase a character's Attributes.

#### Skill Points

The number of points you get to spend on Core Skills, Vocations, and Combat Skills.

#### Disabling Characteristics

See Disabling Characteristics rules.

At character creation, for each Disabling Characteristic that makes a Core Skill Incompetent (level -1), an additional skill point is gained.

At character creation, players characters that take a Disabling Characteristic that results in a -1 in an Attribute (STR, RFX, or INT would be Feeble, Heavy, Dim-witted, etc...) gain an additional 2 skill points.

#### Tiers of Play

#### Apprentice Tier (D&D Level 1 - 4)

Represent a group of mostly wide eyed/unexperienced characters setting out on their first true adventure.

## Character Creation

This document introduces a step by step walk through of how to build a character.

### Step 0: Javk Wick's character creation house rules (Optional)

Howdy all, this is Javk Wick. Here are some house rules for character creation that I implement almost all of my campaigns, especially with brand new players. They've served me very well and I'd highly encourage you to use them to avoid common pitfalls.

#### Player Characters can't start evil

Unless the Narrator is running an evil campaign, player characters can't start as evil.

Reason being, the majority of players won't be evil characters. Early on, as at this point there is minimal connection between a party of characters, the majority good portion of the party will either boot out or kill the evil character for one of their evil deeds. With new players this will undoubtedly cause some real world friction and the now narratively dead player will have to make a whole new character mid campaign.

However, notice how I said "Player Characters can't start evil" and not "No evil Player Characters". The reality is, that it is awesome for the narrative when player characters have a tight knit group, and one of the characters turns to the dark side for in their mind compelling reasons. Since all the player characters have history with one another, they are more likely to not boot or kill the now evil character, and instead try to bring them back to the light. This inevitably becomes the heart of the story, and is extremely gripping. Anakin Skywalker is the best example of this effect in narrative, as we are able to watch his downfall.

#### No joke Player Characters

Unless the narrator is running a goofy/silly campaign, no joke player characters.

You can easily spot a joke character when they are completely clashing with the themes and world setting that the narrator has chosen for the campaign. For example, it would be completely out of place to have a character that is essentially Spongebob in a gritty dark fantasy setting. These characters end up ruining the immersion of other players and make it difficult for the narrator to get across the world he/she has envisioned.

#### No loner Player Characters

No loner/antisocial characters that constantly split the group and never interact with the other player characters.

The player characters are the main characters and main characters interact with one another. They should also probably like the other characters or at least have a reason why they have to work together. Table top roleplay games are at their core about spending quality time with your friends. If a player wants to have the loner experience, they can go play Skyrim or something.

### Step 1: Start with an archetype

For people who have never made a character before, it can be quite daunting to know where to start. Fear not, as you likely already have all the knowledge you need from the movies, shows, books, and other media you have watched through your life.

Picking an archetype is a great starting place to think about a character. It doesn't mean that your character has to stick purely to the archetype. It is more of a jumping off point.

These archetypes can of course depends on the setting you are playing in, though you'd be surprised how much a wizards in a fantasy setting is narratively similar to a mad scientist in a cyber punk setting. What follows is a non-exhaustive list of some common archetypes found in fantasy.

#### Strength Archetypes

- The Fighter
- The Warrior
- The Knight
- The Barbarian

#### Reflex Archetypes

- The Rogue
- The Thief
- The Assassin
- The Martial Artist

#### Intelligence Archetypes

- The Wizard (Abilities gained through intense study)
- The Bard (Abilities gained through learning to socially influence people)
- The Charlatan
- The Detective

#### Other Magical Archetypes

- The Warlock (Abilities gained through a pact with a powerful entity)
- The Sorcerer (Abilities gained through their bloodline)
- The Druid (Abilities gained through their connection to nature)

#### Additional Archetypes

- The Criminal
- The Orphan
- The Local Hero

### Step 2: Understand what Tier Of Play you're playing

A Tier Of Play narratively describe the stakes of the campaign. Your narrator should let you know your tier of play and you should factor this into your character as it would be silly to have your character's backstory to paint them as a master wizard only to have them start in the Apprentice Tier Of Play. Also realize that your character will grow throughout the course of their story and your narrator will be rewarding you will skill points as you play.

### Step 3: Write a rough Backstory

Given the archetype you chose, the tier of play, and world setting the narrator has chosen, write a rough backstory about your character. You'll come back later at the end to polish it, but just get across the broad strokes at this stage.

Here are some important questions to ask about your character:

- What is your name?
- Where are you from?
- What is their sex?
- What is their age?
- What is their race?
- Does your race have innate abilities like magic?
- What strengths do you have?
- What flaws do you have?
- What is their appearance (hair color, eye color, skin color, height, weight, body type)? Finding some character art or generating some ai art is very useful for this step.
- What is their disposition (i.e. how do they act most of the time)?
- What are their beliefs/morality?
- What are their goals/aspirations?
- Do they have friends/family?
- Do they have romantic interests/exes.

### Step 4: Pick your Vocation, spend your Vocation Point

Regardless of the Tier Of Play, you'll have a vocation point to spend. This is a point you get to spend to unlock your first Vocation, whatever your character's life path/job has been. Luckily, if you already picked an archetype that you are going for, you've probably already have your Vocation. For instance, if I wanted to play a Rogue archetype, than my vocation could just be Rogue.

### Step 5: Choose Disabling Characteristics

Disabling Characteristics represent flaws your character has. This is an essential part of every character as everyone needs a short coming to overcome or temptation to fall to. It should be noted that Disabling Characteristics can be remedied through narrative with the Narrators approval.

### Step 6: Spend your Attribute Points

Attributes represent the innate characteristics of your character. They have one of the largest impacts on your character so you should choose wisely. Most often you'd choose attributes that make sense given your Vocation ( Strength for Barbarian, Reflex for Rogue, Intelligence for Wizard, etc...).

### Step 7: Spend your Skill Points

Each Skill Point can be used to increase one core skill, vocation, or combat skill level by 1. It should be noted that no skill can increased above the "Skill/Vocation Level Cap" as defined by your Tier Of Play.

### Step 8: Determine your starting equipment

If the setting has an built economy such as Fallen, based on your characters backstory the Narrator will assign your socioeconomic status. Then you choose whether to roll for your wealth or take the average.

If the setting doesn't have a built economy, then the players and Narrator can work together to figure out what equipment your character might have based on their backstory and Tier Of Play.

# Hardcore Rules

## Item Durability (Optional)

This is an optional rule for setting where the durability of ones equipment has narrative significance. Using item durability is a great way to increase immersion (such as having to go to a blacksmith or learn to repair their gear) and challenge your players. However, for players who want a more casual experience, item durability can be disregarded.

With these rules, all weapons, armor, and spellcasting focuses now have durability. Whatever the Base Dice Tier associated with that item determines how much durability it has. When an item's durability falls, each time your item's durability falls to the lower tier's max durability, that lower tier's base dice are used instead. For instance, if a character had a "Legendary\" Base Dice Tier sword with only 23 durability remaining they would be rolling the "Superior" Base Dice Tier or "1d10, 2d8".

### Weapon Durability

A weapon's Durability decreases by 1 whenever a weapon is used to attempt to inflict an injury level.

### Spellcasting Focus Durability

A Spellcasting Focus's durability decreases by 1 whenever a Spell is cast with it.

### Armor Durability

If an injury is fully negated by armor, then the defender can decide which pieces of armor take armor damage. The armor must sum up to the defense level required to prevent the incoming injury and all take the same amount of armor damage. An armor's durability decreases by the level of injury inflicted plus the attack's defense penetration.

- Armor damage = (level of injury inflicted) + (combat roll penetration)

If an injury is not fully negated by the defender's armor, then all pieces of armor take armor damage.
